    "brief_summary": "Background:\n\nThere is general agreement that statin-treatment of patients to lower plasma cholesterol levels can increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in some individuals1-5. The physiologic mechanism for the increased risk for T2D from statin treatment is unknown but could result from effects on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. This study will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in non-diabetic individuals in regards to its effect on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to help further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrence of T2D in people who are at risk for T2D. This research study will also examine what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2D.\n\nThe goals of this study are to:\n\n1. determine the effect of high-intensity atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for \\~ 10 weeks on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (defined with gold standard methods) (PRIMARY OUTCOMES) as well as other glycemic traits (SECONDARY OUTCOMES);\n2. compare a number of cardio-metabolic characteristics (e.g. weight, lipids) before, during, and after administration of atorvastatin;\n3. determine if significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion following statin treatment will be confined to those with baseline insulin resistance (PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUP ANALYSES);\n4. perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) 6,7 before and after taking atorvastatin to examine treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables and to analyze not only previously-known drug efficacy but also untargeted drug efficacy (EXPLORATORY ANALYSES).\n\nGeneral approach:\n\nThis will be an open-label study to evaluate the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin (40 mg/day for 10 weeks) on both insulin action and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. To ensure we recruit individuals across a broad range of insulin sensitivity, we will target recruitment to enrich for those with combined increases in LDL-C and TG concentrations (see SIGNIFICANCE and RATIONALE). The experimental population will consist of \\~75 apparently healthy, non-diabetic volunteers eligible for statin therapy but without pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Following baseline assessments of co-primary outcome measures: insulin sensitivity (by insulin suppression test, IST) and insulin secretion (by graded glucose infusion test, GGIT), participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet and treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. All baseline measurements will be repeated \\~10 weeks later with iPOP8 measurements done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, and 10 on atorvastatin, and at weeks 4 and 8 off atorvastatin.",
    "detailed_description": "1. SIGNIFICANCE\n\n   Statins and the risk of T2D: Statin treatment is associated with an increase in incident T2D.1-4 5\n\n   Mechanism of statin-induced T2D: It is unclear whether statins increase the risk of T2D by decreasing insulin action, secretion, or both. Several manuscripts have been published that substantially increase understanding of the link between statin use and incident T2D. Swerdlow, et al.2 based on evidence from genetic analysis and randomized trials, concluded that the increased risk of T2D noted with statins is at least \"partially explained by HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibition.\" They also noted an association of weight gain with HMGCR variants in statin-treated patients, leading to the notion that decreases in insulin sensitivity contribute to statin-induced diabetes. In that context, Cederberg, at al.9 have shown in a large prospective study (n=8749 men) that participants treated with statins (n=2142) had a 46% increase in incident T2D, associated with a 24% decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 12% decrease in insulin secretion assessed by surrogate measures.\n\n   Identifying those with at enhanced risk of statin-induced T2D: Studies of 3 randomized clinical trials with atorvastatin by David Waters' group 1,3,4 have demonstrated that \"baseline fasting glucose, body mass index, hypertension, and fasting triglycerides were independent predictors of T2D.\" These abnormalities form a cluster attributed to insulin resistance.10 Since insulin resistance is a predictor of developing T2D, it seems likely that the more insulin resistant the individuals are before treatment, the greater is their risk to for statin-induced T2D.\n\n   In that context, relatively little attention has been given to the role that metabolic heterogeneity in patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations might play in statin-induced T2D. Specifically, subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations, whose plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are also elevated, are insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant as compared to those with isolated LDL-C levels. As such, this subset of patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations can be viewed as being at a \"tipping point,\" and any adverse effect of statins on insulin action and/or secretion, irrespective of how mediated, places them at enhanced risk to develop statin-induced diabetes. Indeed, we have shown (Kohli et al)1 that patients with both insulin resistance (as estimated by high TGs) and prediabetes are at particularly high risk of statin-induced T2D.\n\n   We seek to address 2 important unanswered questions: Do statins primarily affect insulin resistance or insulin secretion?; Are there subsets of individuals at highest risk of statin-induced T2D?\n2. RATIONALE, HYPOTHESIS\n\n   Rationale:\n\n   T2D develops when insulin resistant individuals cannot maintain the degree of compensatory hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. However, significant fundamental questions remain. For example, what is the cellular/molecular link between statin treatment and changes in insulin action and secretion?\n\n   This proposal is based on the premise that studying the effect of statins on insulin action and insulin secretion using \"gold standard\" methods will help determine if statins adversely affect the risk of T2D by increasing insulin resistance or decreasing insulin secretion. We use the insulin suppression test (with the read-out of steady-state plasma glucose, SSPG) to ascertain insulin sensitivity and the graded glucose infusion test (with the readout of insulin secretion rate, ISR) to ascertain insulin secretion both before and after statin treatment in non-diabetic individuals.\n\n   We hypothesize that treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. Thus, we plan to look at the effect of atorvastatin not only in all participants but also in subsets of individuals with baseline insulin resistance (which will be enriched for by recruiting volunteers with elevated plasma TG levels (\u2265150 mg/dL) at baseline. The rationale for this is that plasma TGs are a surrogate measure for insulin resistance with a modest correlation with the direct measure of insulin resistance (steady-state plasma glucose) measured by the insulin suppression test. Clinically, subjects with elevated TGs prior to statin treatment would have substantial clinical benefit from statins, and one of investigators' secondary goals is to demonstrate that a simple measurement of plasma TG concentration (as a surrogate for insulin resistance) can help identify those most at risk of statin induced derangements in glycemic control. Consequently, we propose to enroll nondiabetic volunteers at high-risk for T2D, free of known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), not receiving statins, eligible for statin therapy according to ACC/AHA (American College for Cardiology/American Heart Association) 2013 guidelines.11 We will also target recruitment efforts to enrich for subjects with plasma TG concentration \u2265 150 mg/dL to ensure that we enroll subjects across the range of insulin sensitivity.\n\n   Hypothesis: We hypothesize that high intensity atorvastatin treatment for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance.\n3. STUDY DESIGN\n\n   Sample Size\n\n   \u2022 We aim to recruit and retain 75 total participants in this study.\n\n   Study Location\n\n   \u2022 Clinical and Translational Research Unit (CTRU) at 800 Welch Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304.\n\n   Duration\n\n   \u2022 We anticipate that the entire study will take 4 - 5 years through the end of data analysis. Each eligible candidate who voluntarily consents to participate in the study will be active in the study for a total of 5 months from screening to the end of their last visit.\n4. STUDY PROCEDURES\n\n   Recruitment\n\n   Preliminary recruitment strategies will include:\n\n   Volunteers will be recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area through advertisements in newspapers, posted flyers, and the social networking site NextDoor as well as from the Preventive Cardiology Clinics at Stanford Health Care. Our goal is to ensure recruitment across a broad range of insulin sensitivity. Prior work from our group and others has shown that high plasma TG concentrations are associated with increased insulin resistance as assessed by reference measures. Therefore, we will target advertisements to enrich for individuals with high TG levels (\\> 150 mg/dL) as a surrogate for increased insulin resistance.\n\n   Participant Visits and Procedures\n\n   Potential participants will be screened initially when they call or email in response to recruitment ads, or a letter from their MD, describing the study as follows:\n\n   Preliminary intake will occur over the phone.\n\n   Visit 1 Screening visit.\n\n   Visit 2: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): This test will take approximately 3 hours.\n\n   i) Glycemic status: Participants will be classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or combined IFG/IGT12. In addition, the total integrated plasma glucose response during the OGTT will be calculated by the trapezoidal method (Glucose-AUC).\n\n   ii) \u03b2-cell function: Calculations of the Insulin Secretion- Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) will be used to quantify insulin secretory function 13, if for some reason a graded glucose infusion study is not done. The ISSI-2 is a validated OGTT- derived method to measure of \u03b2-cell function, analogous to the disposition index obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test 14. It is calculated by multiplying the insulin secretory response during the OGTT (Insulin-AUC/Glucose-AUC) by insulin resistance (Matsuda index).\n\n   The fasting and 2-hour glucose results will be discussed with the study participant and a copy of the results will be given to them.\n\n   Visit 3. Graded Glucose Infusion, GGIT 15,16: This test will take approximately 6 hours.\n\n   This test is designed to assess the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin in response to a graded glucose infusion. During this test, subjects will have two small IV catheters placed, one in each arm. One IV will be used for drawing samples and the other for the infusion of glucose. During the GGIT, continuous intravenous infusions of glucose will be given at progressively increasing rates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 kg/min in six infusion periods of 40-min duration. Blood samples will be collected for measurements of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations at fasting and at 30 min and 40 min into each infusion period. The two values during the last 10 min of each infusion period will be averaged. The amount of blood taken for this test will 47.5 ml.\n\n   Visit 4.Insulin Suppression test, IST 17,18: This test will take approximately 6 hours.\n\n   This test is designed to determine whole body insulin sensitivity. Following an overnight fast, subjects will have an IV placed in each arm. One for collection of blood and the other for infusion with octreotide (0.27 \u03bcg/m2/min), insulin (32 mU/m2/min), and glucose (267 mg/m2/min) for 180 minutes. During the test, endogenous insulin is suppressed and all individuals are given the same concentration of insulin, based on their body surface area. Blood is drawn every 30 minutes for 150 minutes and then at 10-minute intervals from 150 to 180 minutes of the infusion to measure plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. The mean of the last four values is used as the steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) and glucose (SSPG) concentrations for each individual. As SSPI concentrations are similar in all subjects during the IST, the SSPG concentration provides a direct measure of the ability of insulin to mediate disposal of an infused glucose load; the higher the SSPG concentration, the more insulin resistant the individual. Labs to check kidney and liver function plus a lipid panel and a urine pregnancy test (if appropriate) will be done at this visit. Blood drawn or IST will be 58.5 ml and 5 ml for SHC labs.\n\n   Labs for iPOP will be drawn at this time and additional samples will be obtained for transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome, and proteome analysis in blood; nasal, tongue, skin surface swabs; urine; and stool.\n\n   The study drug, atorvastatin 40 mg will be given to study participants, once all labs have been reviewed and participant qualifies.\n\n   Visit 5-7: Visits will be every 2 weeks for a total of 10 weeks on study medication (statin). Participants will be assessed for any side effects or adverse events (AE) on the statin. Adherence to study medication will be assessed at each visit.\n\n   Visit 8: Weight, vital signs, and OGTT described above.\n\n   Visit 9: Repeat GGIT as described above.\n\n   Visit 10: Repeat IST and iPOP lab testing and samples as described above. At the end of this visit, the statin will be stopped and the study participant would be scheduled for 4- and 8-week follow up visits.\n\n   Visit 11: One month off statin study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.\n\n   Visit 12: Last study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.\n\n   Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaire about her/his physical activity status, food and eating habits, and stress at the time of each iPOP.\n5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nBased on our prior work19, we calculated that with 60 subjects, we would be able to detect an 8% change in SSPG concentration and an 8% change in ISRAUC after atorvastatin therapy with 80% power and two-side significance level of 5% using a paired samples t test. Thus, we estimated needing to enroll 75 subjects with an anticipated a dropout rate of 20%.\n\nSummary statistics will be reported as median (interquartile range) or number (percent) of participants unless otherwise specified. Shapiro-Wilk tests will be used to assess normality of data, and variables that are not normally distributed will be log-transformed. Percent changes in variables will be calculated by the formula: \\[(end-of study value) - (baseline value) / baseline value\\] x 100. Paired samples t tests will be used to compare baseline and end-of-study means. One sample t tests will be employed to evaluate whether percent changes in variables are significantly different from zero (no change). Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to determine the strength of association between variables of interest. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be carried out by stratifying for insulin resistant versus insulin sensitive subjects. The SSPG concentration median will be used to define subjects as being insulin resistant or insulin sensitive. Insulin resistant and insulin sensitive group means will be compared by independent sample t tests and proportions by chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Statistical analyses will be performed by using statistical software IBM SPSS version 26.0.",

As a secondary endpoints the investigators will determine the effect of intensive insulin therapy on organ dysfunction and mortality of these patients.",
    "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe treatment of the sepsis can be done at three different level:\n\n1. Etiologic therapy. The eradication of the infectious agent is the primary end-point. An appropriate surgical treatment and antibiotic therapy are the key of the etiologic therapy.\n2. Symptomatic therapy. It is the traditional approach in the Intensive Care Unit. It involves to correct the symptomatic issues that can lead to the death of the patients, buying the time necessary for the action of the etiologic and the pathogenic therapy. The key point of the symptomatic therapy are: a) an adequate expansion of the volemia and the use of cardiovascular-acting drugs, for the maintenance of an adequate cardiocirculatory homeostasis. Recently it has been demonstrated that an early aggressive haemodynamic therapy direct to maintain a mixed venous Oxygen Saturation above 70% improved the mortality compared with a standard approach (3); b) apply a mechanical ventilation adequate for the maintenance of the respiratory homeostasis. In fact it has been recently shown an increased survival rate in patients treated with low tidal volume ventilation strategy compared to standard strategy.\n3. Pathogenic therapy. It consists to block the inflammatory and/or coagulation pathway at different level. In the last 30 years a number of report studied different approach (anti-endotoxin antibodies, anti-TNF antibodies, anti-IL6 antibodies, treatment with high doses of corticosteroid, etc.). While all these approaches showed an efficacy in experimental settings when given preventively, most of them have no effect in phase 3 clinical trial. This discrepancy may be explained considering: 1) the system can be considered chaotic, with riddance and interdependency of the response; 2) in the clinical studies the treatment was applied after the development of the sepsis, when the inflammatory and coagulation systems are still largely activated.\n\nThree study has recently demonstrated a benefit in survival:\n\n1. The treatment with low-dosage corticosteroids in patients non-responders to ACH stimulation test (5). This is a substitutive therapy. It is important to note that the treatment with high dosage corticosteroids to block completely the inflammatory response is not effective (6).\n2. The treatment with recombinant activated Protein C (7) did increased the relative survival rate by 20%. Of note the activated Protein C is the only molecule with three main mechanisms of action: anticoagulatory, antiinflammatory and profibrinolytic.\n3. In a recent study in post-surgical patients it has been shown a significant improvement in survival in patients treated with a a tight glycemic control within 80 and 110 mg/dL compared to those in which the glycemia was corrected only when reaching higher level (\\>215 mg/dL) (8).We still lack a definitive explanation for these findings, and the discussion is mainly on the relative roles of glycemia per se versus insulin therapy per se.\n\nHowever, looking at the overall scenario, some issues are of note:\n\n1. We know that a complete block of the inflammatory reaction or a complete block of the coagulation cascade do not improve outcome in septic patients\n2. The activated Protein C is the molecule with the highest spectrum of action, in particular is the only molecule within the numerous molecules tested with pro-fibrinolytic activity\n3. We know that higher glycemia per se does greatly increase the PAI production (the molecule which inhibits the fibrinolysis).\n4. The septic patients primarily die because of multiple organ dysfunction which is in part due to a widespread microthrombosis.\n\nA possible unifying hypothesis is that the improved outcome observed with activate Protein C and with the tight glycemic control is due to the maintenance of a physiologic fibrinolysis. This hypothesis has never been tested and if proved could open interesting therapeutical approaches in the septic patients exposed to the high mortality risk.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The primary end-point is the evaluation of the activation/deactivation of the fibrinolytic system in the two-randomization groups.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: This study is a multicenter, randomized, Phase 2/3 study of adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. We will enroll a total of approximately 80 adult patients.\n\nTREATMENTS ADMINISTERED\n\n1. Control: glycemia will be controlled with insulin administration when higher than 215 mg/dL.\n2. Treatment: glycemia will be controlled with be controlled with insulin administration when higher than 110 mg/dL.\n\nRANDOMIZATION: The patients enrolled will undergo a block-randomization by center in two arms and stratified according to the clinical decision of the caring physician to use or not use the activated Protein C.\n\nDATA COLLECTION: The clinical variables and the biochemical variables of fibrinolysis, coagulation, contact phase and pro-inflammatory cytokines will be recorded daily for the first 7 days, each second day until the 14 days and the each fifth until the end of the study (28th day, or dimission/death if before).\n\nAt Baseline:Demographic data\n\nEvery 24 hours:\n\n1. Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) (9). The Simplified Acute Physiology Score assesses the severity of illness on the basis of 12 physiological variables; age, the type of admission (urgent or nonurgent) and 3 variables related to the underlying disease. Scores can range from 0 to 194; higher scores are correlated with a higher risk of death during hospitalization\n2. SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) (10). It is an index of multi-organ dysfunction (range 0-24).\n3. Ramsey scale (11). It is an index of level of sedation (range 1-6).\n4. Respiratory, circulatory and biochemical of variables for monitoring the organs dysfunction (4).\n\nThe main biochemical variables collected are:\n\n* Fibrinolytic system:\n\n  1. PAI-1 activity\n  2. PAI- 1 antigen\n  3. tPA antigen\n  4. Plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP)\n  5. D-Dimer fragment\n  6. Polymorphism 4G/5 of the PAI-1 gene\n* Final phase pf the coagulation pathway\n\n  1. Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT)\n  2. Prothrombin fragment F1 + 2\n* Contact system\n\n  1. Activated Factor XII (FXIIa)\n  2. Metabolism of endogenous bradykinin\n  3. Polymorphism insertion/deletion of the gene of angiotensin converting enzyme\n* Inflammation\n\n  1. C reactive protein (CRP)\n  2. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)\n  3. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\n  4. C3a\n  5. SC5b-9\n\nSAFETY ASPECTS AND SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) REPORTING: GCP rules will be strictly applied, including timely reporting to the study coordination within 48 hours from their occurrence of the SAEs not included in the efficacy end-points. Clinical investigators and nurses of each of the participating centers will be instructed to monitor specifically and to document the adverse events more likely to be associated with the study treatment.\n\nSTATISTICAL ASPECTS: we plan to enroll 80 septic patients in the ICU related with the participating research units. This size will allow showing an average difference of 30% of fibrinolysis biochemical parameters (alfa = 0.05, 1-beta = 0.80).\n\nADMINISTRATIVE, LEGAL, ETHICAL ISSUES: This study is designed by our collaborative group, which has been active over the last ten years in conducting clinical trials in intensive care. The study has been planned and is managed independently, and the clinicians who take active part in the study do not receive economic incentives. The Ely Lilly Italia Spa will provide a financial support for performing the laboratory tests required in studying the fibrinolysis. It is important to emphasize that we are comparing the effects of two different strategies of glycemic control on the fibrinolysis. The Ely Lilly interest in the study is only scientific, as, if we could show the importance of the fibrinolysis in sepsis, this could elucidate one of the putative mechanisms of activated Protein C action. This study is also partially funded by a grant of the Ministry of University and research (COFIN 2004).\n\nThe data which are produced belong to the study group, who ensures their publication and their availability for public authorities.\n\nAll data related to the patients included in the study are treated in strict compliance with the Italian Laws related to privacy 675/1996.\n\nThe informed consent for the patients will be administered as soon as and every time the clinical conditions of the same patients are compatible with the procedure, thus following the provisions set forth by the ICH-GCP guidelines (13), and confirmed by the most recent European Directive 2001/20/CE Decreto Legislativo 211 24/06/2003. It is worth recalling that there is no legal basis for requiring the consent to a relative of the patient.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

The first intervention is based on the novel concept of initiating therapy at the time of diagnosis with combination therapy using agents that correct specific pathophysiologic defects that are characteristic of T2DM (insulin resistance and beta cell failure).

The cyclic intermittent hypoxia in OSA is the primary stimulus that leads to insulin resistance, a primary risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. There is an association between the level of hypoxic stress in OSA and insulin resistance.\n\nThe overall hypothesis to be tested is that treatment of OSA with MAD will improve insulin sensitivity, increase levels of HMW (High-molecular- weight) adiponectin, and improve psychological adjustment.",

Early control of high blood gluocse prevents progressive deterioration and treatment escalation. People with diabetes have impaired insulin secretion, the only hormone that can lower blood glucose, or resistance to insulin action. There are trillions of microrganisms (tiny living things including bacteria) in the gut that can interact with foods and medicine to alter bodily functions including insulin secretion and its actions. Studies in animals and human suggested that a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) containing a combination of four herbs (Jinmai, abbreviated as JM) reduced blood glucose by increasing insulin secretion accompanied by favorable changes in gut bacteria and expression of genetic information that regulate bodily functions.\n\nIn this study, people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for less than 6 years and not treated with any glucose lowering drugs are assigned randomly to recieve 1) high dose JM (JM-HD) or 2) low dose JM (JM-LD) or 3) look-alike dummy (placebo) given in powder form to be dissolved in water taken twice daily for 24 weeks. We shall compare the abilities of these 3 combination products to lower blood glucose over a 2-hour period after taking a nutritional drink at 0, 12 and 24 weeks. The assigned treatment will then be discontinued for 12 weeks and the test will be repeated to see if improvement is sustained. Samples will be collected at week 0 and 24 (on-treatment) and week 36 (12 weeks off-treament) to compare changes in gut bacteria in faeces and expression of genetic information that make proteins which regulate blood glucose amongst these 3 groups.",
    "detailed_description": "People with impaired insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells is the main cause of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This can be demonstrated by measuring insulin secretion following an 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Other pathophysiological processes underlying diabetes include non-suppression of glucagon from pancreatic alpha-cells with increased fasting blood glucose, abnormal incretin (e.g. glucagon like peptide GLP1) secretion from gut which augment insulin secretion during food intake as well as changes in gut microbiota which can interact with foods and medicine to alter hormonal secretion and metabolic milieu. Obesity, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidemia can alter inflammatory pathways, transcription factors and oxidative stress resulting in further impairment of insulin secretion and its actions. Early attainment of glycemic control can break these vicious cycles, improve glycemic durability and reduce progressive treatment escalation.\n\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses indicate that TCM containing multiple active components may prevent and control diabetes in human. In animal studies, our group first reported that a combination of extracts from 3 herbs (Coptidis Rhizoma; Astragali Radix; Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, abbreviated as CAL) lowered blood glucose in diabetic rats with sustained improvement in insulin resistance and beta-cell function accompanied by resolution of fatty liver. These effects persisted for weeks or months after treatment discontinuation depending on treatment duration. These improvements were accompanied by changes in gene expression (RNA and microRNA) implicated in energy metabolism. In another animal study, we first reported that extracts from Ophiopogonis (Oph) increased insulin secretion, reduced inflammation and expanded islet mass with lowering of blood glucose.\n\nBased on these mechanistic studies, we designed a proprietary formula consisting of CAL plus Oph (referred as Jinmai, JM). We randomized people with prediabetes to recieve 12-week treatment with 1) CAL only, 2) CAL+Oph low dose (JM-LD), 3) CAL+Oph very low dose (JM-VLD) and 4) consultation with CM practitioners (control), followed by treatment discontinuation for 12 weeks. Amongst these 4 groups, participants treated with JM-LD had signficant reduction in blood glucose and increased insulin secretion during 75 gram OGTT. This effect was sustained after discontinuation of JM-LD for 3 months. Microbiota and RNA analysis indicated that JM-LD caused favorable changes in microbiota and gene expression which correlated with these metabolic changes.\n\nBased on these consistent evidence, we produced a proprietary JM formula consisting of a fixed combination of extracts of CAL with low dose (JM-LD) or high dose extracts of Oph (JM-HD) under good manufacturing practice. The study was approved by the Hong Kong Department of Health for investigational use aimed at registering JM as a novel CM for prevention and treatment of T2D.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nA 24-week treatment with JM in people with T2D reduce glucose excursion and improve beta-cell function through changes in gut microbiota and gene expression\n\nStudy design:\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT to assess the efficacy, safety and multiomic effects of JM and its optimal dose in people with early T2D (within 6 years) not treated with glucose lowering drugs.\n\nIntervention:\n\nRandomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 24-week treatment with\n\n1. JM-LD in powder form (13.5 g twice daily) to be dissolved in 250 ml of hot water\n2. JM-HD in powder form (13.5 g twice daily) to be dissolved in 250 ml of hot water or\n3. matching placebo in powder form (13.5 g twice daily) to be dissolved in 250 ml of hot water followed by treatment discontinuation for 3 months\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo compare changes in glucose excursion during MMTT after 24 week treatment with JM-LD or JM-HD compared to placebo\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the sustained effect of JM on glucose exursion during MMTT 12 weeks after JM discontinuation compared to placebo\n2. To compare changes in cardiometabolic risk factors including blood pressure, lipids and body weight and HbA1c as well as insulin secretion and resistance during MMTT after 24 weeks of JM treatment compared to placebo\n3. To compare changes in biomarkers and multiomics and their correlations with metabolic changes after 24 weeks of JM treatment compared to placebo\n\nPrimary outcome measure:\n\nBetween-group difference in area-under-the-curve of plasma glucose (AUC-PG) during MMTT in the JM group versus changes in the placebo group (difference-difference) from week 0 to 24 (on treatment)\n\nSample size:\n\nIn the aforementioned 12-week study of JM versus placebo in people with prediabetes, the mean (SD) of AUC-PG during OGTT in placebo group was 18.9 (1.8) mmol/L/min. The AUC-PG was 1.89 mmol/L/min, i.e. 10% lower in the JM-LD group than the placebo group. Based on a conservative estimation of a superiority margin of 0.945 (5% of mean difference) in favor of JM-HD versus placebo, 45 participants in each arm are needed to achieve an 80% power at one-sided significance level of 5%. Allowing a 20% drop out rate, we shall assign 54 participants to each of 3 groups with a total of 162 participants.\n\nStudy site:\n\nThe study will be conducted at Ward 3M, Diabetes and Endocrine Research Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) stipulated by the CUHK-NTEC Clinical Research Management Office\n\nSignificance of the study:\n\nThis double-blind placebo-controlled RCT will provide data in support of the beneficial effects of a novel proprietary CM formula (JM) on glycemic excursion in people with early T2D as a therapeutic option. The effects of JM on beta-cell function, insulin resistance, biomarkers, multiomics and gut microbiota will explain the mechanisms underlying the benefits of JM. These data will provide the basis for conduct of large-scale study to examine the effects of JM in the prevention of T2D and its progression to non-communicable diseases.",

On the other hand, animal data are promising in prevention of various cancer types, coronary heart diseases and diabetes which strongly indicate the need for human clinical trials.\n\nFurthermore, data are lacking either about safety during long-term administration, or on the efficacy of resveratrol administration in patients with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of resveratrol on inflammatory mediators in type 2 diabetic patients in vivo.\n\nThis research will investigate the hypothesis that resveratrol, when given orally to type 2 diabetic subjects for 24 weeks induces a decrease in values of high-sensitivity CRP (C-reactive protein) (primary outcome measure), IL-6 (Interleukin-6), PTX3 (pentraxin 3).\n\nThe investigators will also investigate the hypothesis that resveratrol has an antioxidant activity, improves insulin sensitivity and lipid pattern, down-regulates bone-turnover. Secondary outcomes are therefore variations in the following variables: TAS (total antioxidant status), glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, body composition (evaluated by Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry DXA-), bone mineral density (DXA).\n\nFinally, the investigators are interested in evaluating efficacy, safety and tolerability of two different dosages of resveratrol: 500 mg/day and 40 mg/day.",

    "brief_summary": "Around the world, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been increasing since the last two decades, with approximately 347 million patients with diabetes by 2013 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This pronounced increase is due to an increase in the prevalence of obesity, reduction in physical activity levels, accelerated urbanization and aging of the population. In Colombia, T2DM ranks fifth in the main morbidity and mortality causes, including only deaths caused directly and without adding the strong influence that T2DM has on cardiovascular disease mortality.\n\nInsufficient tissue response to normal insulin concentrations, called insulin resistance, is one of the central pathophysiological mechanisms in the development of T2DM. However, there is currently no simple, practical, safe and reproducible method that allows the diagnosis or identification of insulin resistance, nor the follow-up to its evolution. At the moment, the gold standard for assessing the degree of insulin sensitivity or resistance is the \"hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp\", a laborious technique, of high cost and high technical difficulty, requiring specialized personnel and hospitalization. Non-invasive methods based on mathematical regressions, such as the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), are imperfect and widely variable, and have not been validated in the Latin American population, less Still Colombian.\n\nTherefore, the development of new, easily obtainable quantitative tools for the diagnosis of insulin resistance is required. This requires not only the identification of new and better biomarkers, but also the determination of their diagnostic performance and operational characteristics.\n\nThis project will investigate 3 molecular targets (myokines), novel and easy to measure, with high probability of being good biomarkers of insulin resistance. The research will include validation of its association with insulin resistance measured by the reference method, as well as its measurement in apparently healthy individuals. Finally, operator-receiver characteristics of each test will be analyzed, in order to propose a cutoff point for the diagnosis of insulin resistance.",
    "detailed_description": "The objectives of the project are: 1) To identify, within a group of 3 potential new biomarkers of insulin resistance, those that are significantly associated with the presence of this phenomenon in our population, 2) Establish, analyze and apply reference values for each one of these three biomarkers in Colombian population. 3) To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, statistical C (operational performance), predictive values and likelihood ratios of each of the biomarkers studied for the diagnosis of insulin resistance versus a standard gold technique and 4) Different biomarkers evaluated, in order to select the best one (s) for clinical use, as well as to propose a cutoff point for detection of insulin resistance for each of them.\n\nMethodology: A cross-sectional, diagnostic test evaluation study will be conducted, including apparently healthy Adults of both sexes, with ages between 35 and 65 years, coming from Bogot\u00e1, without any significant comorbidity.\n\nAs initial evaluation will be carried out measurement of height, weight, percentage of body fat, blood pressure, diet questionnaire, physical activity and sociocultural characteristics. For patients with prediabetes and T2DM, the time elapsed since the diagnosis will be obtained, as well as information about pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment that they are receiving.\n\nFor the serological evaluation, a sample of venous blood should be taken in the fasted state, with the aim of measuring the following markers: Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) , Myonectin, and Myostatin. In addition to routine tests such as fasting glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting insulinemia, lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C) and C-reactive protein. Additionally, all subjects will participate in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\n\nIn addition to the gold standard of measurement of insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), six of the tools currently available for the search of insulin resistance, all derived from calculations from the measurements of The HOMA beta-cell function (HOMA beta-cell%), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), index 1 / fasting insulin, corrected insulin response, insulin / glucose ratio and insulinemia Of fasting.\n\nFor each biomarker, an operator / receiver characteristics curve (ROC curve) will be calculated, calculating diagnostic performance and cutoff points with the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. A first approximation will be made to baseline values for these tests, based on the distribution of the tests in healthy, and one or more insulin resistance biomarkers with their recommended cutoff points will be proposed.",

    "brief_summary": "Diabetic nephropathy is becoming the most common primary renal disease in end stage renal disease patients. The prevalence of diabetic patients in dialysis reaches even the 30% of the dialysis population (USRDS) with an incidence rate, in some countries, up to 40%. The 5 years surviving time of diabetic patients in dialysis is about the 20% and, compared to the hypertension and glomerulonephritis complications, still remains the worst. Diabetes is often associated to several comorbid factors such as hypertension, autonomic neuropathy, vasculopathy, metabolic disorders (ketoacidosis, poor glycaemic control), and electrolyte disorders. So, the diabetic patient is fragile, with a rather poor tolerance to dialysis, lack of achievement of dry body weight and inadequate dialysis. In order to gain a more detailed insight into a possible better tolerance to dialysis, arising from the elimination of acetate in dialysate bath (Acetate Free Biofiltration) and from the use of an automatic system to control the blood volume (Blood Volume Control),the investigators would like to investigate the cardiovascular stability and the frequency of intradialytic symptoms in a prospective, randomized, cross-over study.",
    "detailed_description": "Acetate-Free-Biofiltration (AFB) was proved to be a technique suitable to treat critical patients, such as elders and diabetics, because of frequency reduction of hypotensive episodes and symptoms during the treatment and a better control to metabolic aspects (such as metabolic acidosis).\n\nThe Blood Volume Control (BVC) is a tool, that allows to improve the cardiovascular tolerance to the treatment, especially in hypotension-prone patients, appearing promising in the correction of the arterial hypertension induced by the hydro-saline overload.\n\nThe use of BVC in AFB has been tested to verify the behaviour of the kinetics of electrolyte (in particular of bicarbonate) and it has got good results, in terms of a further improvement in treatment tolerance, for critical patients However, this therapy (AFB+BVC) was not yet evaluated as the dialysis tolerance improvement in diabetics concern, nor the relative contribution given by each factor in achieving this result.\n\nThe study, 9 months long, is aimed to verify the treatment tolerance of insulin requiring diabetic patients, by using standard bicarbonate dialysis (BD), or Acetate Free Biofiltration (AFB) and/or a Blood Volume Control(BVC). The study is divided in three phases: the first one, three months long, is the baseline in standard bicarbonate dialysis, then all the patients are shifted to AFB with BVC, for other three months, while the last three months long phase, after a randomization, has the aim to identify the relative contribution of each factor (absence of acetate in the bath or BVC) in the treatment tolerance improvement(if any). The treatment tolerance will be evaluated considering the frequency of intradialytic hypotensive events.",

    "detailed_description": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. In a large percentage of cases, the risk factors for CVD are modifiable if the responsible patient's phenotype is identified and appropriately treated. In particular, the metabolic syndrome encompasses insulin resistance, central obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, which are all major risk factors for CVD. These risk factors also cause underlying vascular abnormalities, i.e. endothelial dysfunction, that leads to progression of CVD. Endothelial function is the balance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances produced by the endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of insulin resistance and hypertension. In addition, endothelial dysfunction represents a very early step in the process of atherosclerosis and is associated with increased adverse CVD outcomes.\n\nIt has been well established that lifestyle modifications (changes in dietary intake and increase in physical activity) can effectively improve CVD risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. The success of maintaining these lifestyle changes in humans over the long term is poor. Therefore, strategies to reduce prevalence of metabolic syndrome by pharmacological means have been adopted by practicing physicians. However, because of the widespread use of dietary supplements by the general public, nutritional supplementation that includes use of natural products that effectively modify the components of metabolic syndrome represent an attractive approach.\n\nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables clearly has been shown to have significant health benefits. In particular, increased consumption of blueberries has demonstrated beneficial health effects for CVD and certain components of the metabolic syndrome, such as hypertension, insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes. These health benefits from blueberries may be attributable to their phenolic bioactive compounds, such as anthocyanins, which also have antioxidant properties. Although both human and animal studies demonstrated the anti-diabetic effect of blueberries, there is a paucity of data detailing the efficacy of increased blueberry consumption upon CVD risk factor modification in human subjects. Thus, given the concern regarding the ability to significantly increase and maintain an individual's fruit and vegetable consumption long-term, the role of dietary supplementation with bioactive components contained in whole blueberries becomes not only an attractive, but a feasible daily dietary intervention.\n\nOur lab has previously shown that obese, nondiabetic and insulin-resistant human subjects that consumed blueberry powder once a day (in the form of a blueberry smoothie) for 6 weeks improved their insulin sensitivity when compared to their counterparts that consumed a placebo smoothie. Unfortunately, definitive blood pressure measurements were not conducted in this study. The investigators used a single clinic measurement which did not show any blood pressure lowering effects with consuming the blueberry smoothies. An 8-wk preclinical trialin spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, however, showed that supplementation with blueberry powder lowered systolic blood pressure. Thus, it is plausible that blood pressure lowering effects were not seen in our previous study because the investigators did not evaluate a suitable population (with hypertension) and did not use a more precise technique.\n\nTherefore, based on the positive results in our prior human study with the use of blueberry powder increasing insulin sensitivity and given the relationship of CVD risk factors to insulin resistance, this project's overall objective is to examine the role of dietary supplementation with blueberry powder on CVD risk factors in subjects with metabolic syndrome. In particular, the investigators will evaluate changes in insulin sensitivity with the use of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), hypertension with the use of a precise ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system and vascular reactivity as a surrogate marker for underlying endothelial abnormalities. To our knowledge, no research studies have evaluated endothelial function and blueberries in humans. To accomplish our goal, the investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study with a fixed amount of blueberry powder in the form of a smoothie. The investigators hypothesize that increased daily consumption of blueberry powder will be effective in increasing insulin sensitivity, decreasing blood pressure, and improving vascular wall function in a population with metabolic syndrome that is at high-risk for CVD.",

Ninety participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (n=30 each): a ketogenic-caloric restricted diet, a normal-fat caloric restricted diet, or a control group (normal-fat without caloric restriction). Anthropometric parameters and dietary intake will be evaluated at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and week 12 for measuring fasting glucose, insulin, LPS, inflammatory cytokines. Dietary adherence will be monitored through food records.

Data in mice models have recently demonstrated that circulating immunoglobulins G (IgG) could be involved in the process. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), who are characterized by low circulating levels of IgG, might represent an ideal model to clarify the role played in vivo in humans by circulating IgG. Polyclonal IgG, obtained from multiple donors, given intravenously (IVIgG), are used to treat various immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases, including CVID. By using this disease and its treatment by IVIgG as a model, aim of the current study is to clarify whether IgG affect endothelial function and insulin sensitivity in humans in vivo and whether the action of IgG on the endothelium involves a direct interaction with the endothelial cells.",
    "detailed_description": "For this purposes, 24 patients with CVID, receiving the last therapeutic dose of IVIgG infusion 5-weeks before the baseline measurements (CVID-IVIgG group), are studied. In all subjects, endothelial function is evaluated as flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, measured by ultrasonographic technique at baseline and 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after IVIgG infusion. FMD is also measured in a group of IVIgG naive CVID patients (number of patients recruited depending on availability) and a group of control healthy subjects. The latter FMD measurements serve only as a mere reference of pathological or normal values in condition of deficiency or normal levels of circulating IgG and are not used for primary outcome evaluation. To dissect further the mechanisms of improved endothelial function after IVIgG infusion, we investigate the role of human IgG on the production of Nitric Oxide (NO) in vitro on Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells (HCAEC) isolated from normal human coronary arteries.",

    "detailed_description": "Previous investigations have demonstrated that simply adding 3 small protein feedings to the normal diet of overweight men and women, independent of caloric restriction and/or engaging in exercise training, significantly reduces body weight, fat mass, abdominal fat, waist circumference, and blood fat (triglyceride) levels (Arciero et al JAP, 2014), and confirms previous research (Baer et al, J Nutr, 2011). This timed ingestion is referred to as protein pacing (PP) and has been utilized in numerous scientific investigations with a great deal of success by the PI (see references). This one, simple, dietary modification, independent of reducing calorie intake and/or engaging in exercise training, is noteworthy and exceptional in terms of health improvements derived from diet alone. Unfortunately, the incidence and healthcare costs associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are overwhelming. Currently, more than 34 million Americans have T2DM (1 in 10) and is increasing at alarming rates (\\>4.0%/year) among all segments of the population. Equally disturbing, T2DM costs the US more than $330 billion a year, including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced worker productivity. Thus, identifying evidence-based, effective, time-efficient, and easy-to-follow lifestyle strategies are vital to reducing these staggering healthcare costs and improving the health of T2DM patients. Indeed, lifestyle therapies remain the most effective treatments for T2DM outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the effects of protein (whey) supplementation added to the normal diet of pre-diabetes or diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) men and women on plasma glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and total body fat levels.

    "brief_summary": "Chronically disabled stroke survivors experience accelerated skeletal muscle atrophy and other detrimental changes to muscle and surrounding tissues on the paretic side. This unilateral tissue-level damage contributes to worsening disability and insulin resistance. This VA Merit Award will advance the investigators' understanding of the potential for strength training (ST) to reverse stroke-related muscle abnormalities to improve metabolic health, strength, and function. It will be the first study to thoroughly investigate the effects of ST on muscle atrophy, intramuscular fat, muscle fiber characteristics, capillary density and insulin sensitivity after stroke.",
    "detailed_description": "This study investigates the hypothesis that a novel, high intensity, high repetition ST program will improve abnormalities in paretic and non-paretic leg muscle volume and composition compared to an attention-matched control regimen of supervised stretching over a 3-month intervention period in those disabled by stroke. The investigators further hypothesize that ST-induced skeletal muscle adaptation will translate into improved insulin sensitivity, strength, and function in this population. The specific objectives are to: 1) Determine the effects ST compared to a control intervention on paretic and non-paretic abnormalities in skeletal muscle volume, intramuscular fat, muscle fiber distribution, muscle capillary density, and muscle inflammation in chronically disabled stroke survivors. 2) Determine the effects ST compared to a control intervention on insulin sensitivity in stroke survivors, and whether structural and cellular skeletal muscle mechanisms contribute to improvements in insulin sensitivity after ST. 3) Determine the effects ST compared to a control intervention on physical function (strength, walking speed and balance) in stroke survivors, and whether structural skeletal muscle mechanisms predict ST-induced functional improvement.\n\nThe project design consists of 4 phases over 5 months for stroke participants enrolled in either of the two intervention arms (ST vs. CONTROL). During phase 1 the investigators will screen and consent chronic stroke patients with residual gait deficits. Phase 2 (3 weeks) will consist of baseline testing that includes dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning, bilateral CT scanning of the legs, bilateral vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, strength testing, timed walks, balance measurements, oral glucose tolerance testing, and hyperglycemic clamp testing. Following completion of baseline testing, volunteers are to be randomized to ST or the CONTROL group. Phase 3 (Intervention Phase, 3 months) will begin with 2 sessions of acclimatization for those assigned to the ST group. ST will then be progressed to 2 sets of 20 repetitions on each leg on each machine (Keiser Leg Press, Leg Extension, Leg Curl) with gradual increases in resistance over 3 months. Those in the CONTROL group will receive equal exposure to health care personnel in the Baltimore VA Exercise facility, performing a full battery of upper and lower body passive and active stretching exercises at each intervention session. In Phase 4 all baseline testing and laboratory analyses will be repeated.\n\nDeveloping evidence-based therapies to combat skeletal muscle deterioration is highly relevant for chronically disabled stoke survivors. There is mounting evidence that current models of post-stroke rehabilitation are not optimal for maximizing recovery of muscle mass, strength, and metabolic health. The proposed research will develop new insight into the utility of progressive ST for reversing detrimental changes to gross muscle composition, muscle molecular phenotype, muscle inflammation, and muscle capillarization. Changes to any or all of these muscle parameters should have measurable impact on both whole body insulin sensitivity and function. Collectively, the results from this trial may change the current standard of care for stroke survivors by providing evidenced reasons for augmenting physical therapists' treatments, allowing more intense and diverse therapy sessions for maintenance of skeletal muscle.",

Mexico has the highest prevalence of obesity, (Secretar\u00eda de Salud, 2009); 34.4% of children and 35% of adolescents are overweight or obese (ENSANUT 2012). Obesity has major health consequences for children and adolescents; On the other hand, undernutrition as well has important deleterious consequences on children's health.\n\nAnything that disrupts energy balance may cause individuals to be underweight, overweight or obese. Fat has been considered an endocrine organ for some time (Elizondo, 2011). Recently, skeletal muscle has been shown to function as a peripheral endocrine organ by releasing myokines, (Pedersen, 2012). Most recently, a new identified hormone secreted by muscle tissue in mouse, irisin, has been discovered. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development. Irisin was induced with exercise in mice and humans which caused an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake (Bostr\u00f6m et al., 2012).\n\nIrisin was thus, promptly hypothesized as a hormone influencing body weight, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, among other conditions (Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2012). Some studies have indicated that circulating levels of irisin in humans correlate positively with anthropometric parameters such as BMI, fat mass, fat free mass, and are higher in obese patients compared to lean ones (Stengel et al., 2013; Huh et al., 2012; Roca-Rivada et al., 2013; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo, 2014). Studies have shown an association between irisin levels, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (Park et al., 2013; de la Iglesia et al., 2014; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo et al., 2014). However, some others have found a negative correlation with anthropometric parameters, finding lower irisin levels in obese patients (Moreno-Navarrete et al., 2013). Noteworthy, all these studies have been performed in adults. To date, there are only two studies evaluating irisin levels in children. One found that a 1-year long lifestyle intervention program was associated with an elevation in irisin levels in obese children, although no correlation was found between irisin levels and anthropometric markers (Bl\u00fcher et al., 2014). The other study investigated normal weight Saudi children and found correlations between circulating irisin and glucose and HDLc, but a negative association with insulin resistance (Al-Daghri et al, 2014).\n\nBesides, associations between irisin levels and adiponectin, leptin and resistin in the set of obesity have been explored, the three of them are implicated in the physiopatology of obesity.\n\nAs there are still conflicting data regarding the association of irisin with anthropometric parameters, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as its 'association with other adiponectines, and most important, there is scarce data of these associations in children, the objective of this study will be to correlate the circulating irisin and adipokines levels across a broad spectrum of body mass index ranging from undernourished to obese as well as with insulin resistance and risk factors for the metabolic syndrome in Hispanic children.\n\nThe sample size with statistical power for this study yielded a sample of 40 children. Frozen stored plasma (-80\u00b0C) will be taken from a previous study performed in children which has been published (Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2014). The samples will be divided into five groups, 8 per group, according to the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics body mass index percentile classification: 1.) underweight = \\<3 percentile; 2.) normal weight = \\>3 - \\< 85 percentile; 3.) Overweight = \\>85 - \\< 95 percentile, and 4.) obese = \\> 95 percentile. The fifth group will correspond to children with known metabolic syndrome according to the classification specified by Cooks et al (2008). Anthropometric measurements will include BMI, percentile BMI, waist circumference, % body fat, fat mass, fat free mass, and triceps skin fold. Biochemical measurements will include glucose, total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL-c) and triglycerides. Clinical measurements will include blood pressure, physical activity records and dietary habits. All biochemical, anthropometric and clinical measurements were previously performed in a former published study (Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2014).\n\nIrisin, adiponectin and leptin will be measured in plasma media using commercial ELISA kits.",
    "detailed_description": "Background Childhood obesity is one of the most serious global public health challenges of the 21st century (Daniels et al., 2009). Mexico has the highest prevalence of obesity, worldwide; 34.4% of children and 35% of adolescents are overweight or obese (ENSANUT 2012). Among other complications, overweight and obese children are predisposed to develop dyslipidemias, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at a younger age, as well as to become obese as adults (Daniels et al., 2009; Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2010). On the other hand, undernutrition in children conveys to very detrimental health effects such as stunting, puberty retardation, motor retardation (Roulet et al., 2005), osteoporosis and fractures (Saunders et al., 2011), immunologic deficit, and altered function of every organ and system, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system, among others (Lecours et al, 2001; Saunders et al., 2011).\n\nA balance between energy intake and energy expenditure is required to sustain a normal body weight. Anything that disrupts this balance may cause individuals to be underweight, overweight or obese. Diverse signals, central and peripheric participate in the regulation of energy balance. Fat has been considered an endocrine organ due to the many peptides and hormones that it secrets that act upon peripheral and central tissues, and their contribution to insulin resistance or sensitivity and body weight regulation among other functions (Elizondo, 2011). Recently, skeletal muscle has been shown to function as a peripheral endocrine organ by releasing myokines, peptide signals, which are implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways (Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012). Most recently, a new identified hormone secreted by muscle tissue in mouse, irisin, has been discovered. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development. In mouse, PGC1alfa expression in muscle stimulates increase in expression of FNDC5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as this novel hormone, irisin. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and medley increased irisin levels in blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake (Bostr\u00f6m et al., 2012).\n\nIrisin was thus, promptly hypothesized as a hormone influencing body weight, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, among other conditions (Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2012). Some studies have indicated that circulating levels of irisin in humans correlate positively with anthropometric parameters such as BMI, fat mass, fat free mass, and are higher as these parameters increase, this is, irisin levels are higher in obese patients compared to lean ones (Stengel et al., 2013; Huh et al., 2012; Roca-Rivada et al., 2013; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo et al., 2014). Studies have shown an association between irisin levels, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (Park et al., 2013; de la Iglesia et al., 2014; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo et al., 2014). However, some others have found a negative correlation with anthropometric parameters, finding lower irisin levels in obese patients (Moreno-Navarrete et al., 2013). Noteworthy, all these studies have been performed in adults in different circumstances or diseased states. To date, there are only two studies evaluating irisin levels in children. One found that a 1-year long lifestyle intervention program was associated with improvement in anthropometric and metabolic parameters and led to an elevation in irisin levels in obese children, although no correlation was found between irisin levels and anthropometric markers (Bl\u00fcher et al., 2014). The other study investigated normal weight Saudi children and found correlations between circulating irisin and glucose and HDLc, but a negative association with insulin resistance (Al-Daghri et al., 2014).\n\nBesides, associations between irisin levels and adiponectin, leptin and resistin in the set of obesity have been explored. Leptin plays a pivotal role in regulating energy homeostasis, food intake and many neuroendocrine functions, specially triggering puberty in children. Leptin is increased in obese patients, associated with a leptin-resistant state (Bl\u00fcher and Mantzoros, 2009). Adiponectin is an insulin sensitizing hormone; obese patients have lower levels than normal-weight ones. Circulating adiponectin levels are low in central obesity (Dalamaga et al., 2012), and this low level has been associated with the metabolic syndrome across all ages (Siitonen et al., 2011). Resistin has been associated with insulin resistance, and recently as a proinflamatory adipocytokine (McTernan et al., 2006). Some studies have found a negative correlation between irisin and adiponectin levels (Park et al., 2013), while other have found no association either with leptin or adiponectin (Bl\u00fcher et al., 2014) here are still conflicting data regarding the association of irisin with anthropometric parameters, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as its 'association with other adipokines, and most important, there is scarce data of these associations in children, the objective of this study will be to correlate the circulating irisin and adipokines levels across a broad spectrum of body mass index ranging from undernourished to obese as well as with insulin resistance and risk factors for the metabolic syndrome in Hispanic children.\n\nThere is still conflicting data regarding the association of irisin with anthropometric parameters, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as its 'association with other adipokines, and most important, there is scarce data of these associations in children. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to correlate the circulating irisin and adipokines levels across a broad spectrum of body mass index ranging from undernourished to obese as well as with insulin resistance and risk factors for the metabolic syndrome in Hispanic children.\n\nStudy Population The population was previously described. (Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2014) An open invitation was made to school-aged children from eight public schools representative of all geographical areas of Monterrey, the second largest city in M\u00e9xico. Children that accepted the invitation were randomly selected and screened according to BMI percentiles. The sample size is 40 children. The population will be divided into five groups, 8 per group. Four of the groups will be divided according to the CDC body mass index percentiles: 1.) underweight = \\<3percentile; 2.) normal weight = \\>3 - \\< 85 percentile; 3.) Overweight = \\>85 - \\< 95 percentile, and 4.) obese = \\> 95 percentile. The fifth group will correspond to children with known metabolic syndrome.\n\nSigned consent was obtained from both parents/care givers and children. Approvals by the Ethics and Research Committees of the School of Medicine Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey and by the State Health Secretariat, as well as by the Education Authorities were obtained. Participants did not receive gratification during the study.\n\nAnthropometric and Clinical Evaluation Anthropometric measurements were performed in all participants at each school. Height was determined to the nearest 0.5 cm (portable Seca\u00ae stadiometer, North America) and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg while children wore light clothing, no socks or shoes (TANITA TBF 300\u00ae scale, Arlington, Illinois). Percentage of body fat (%BF) was measured by bioimpedance (same TANITA scale). WC was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the level of the umbilicus with a flexible fiberglass tape while the subjects were standing, after gently exhaling, and with no clothing on the area. Tricipital skin fold (TSF) was measured using a Lange skinfold caliper. BMI was calculated by weight-kilograms divided by the square of height-meters. Fat mass and fat free mass were calculated according to the specific predetermined formulas. Measurements were performed at the same time each day by the same three trained registered dietitians (RD) in all children to control the inter-observer variability. Blood pressure was measured by the same physician, using an aneroid sphygmomanometer (Welch-Allyn\u00ae) following the American Heart Association (AHA) technique; two measurements were obtained while participants were calmed and seated.\n\nLaboratory Assessment Blood samples were taken after a 12-hour overnight fast and were kept at 2 to 8\u00b0C and centrifuged within the first 3 hours. Serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and glucose were measured by reflective photometry (Beer-Lambert's law) using an automated analyzer (Architect c8000; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), with an intra- and inter-assay coefficient variation below 4.7%. Plasma samples were then stored at -80\u00b0C. Irisin, adiponectin, insulin and leptin will be measured in plasma media using commercial ELISA kits. The assays will be conducted in 96-well microplates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Irisin, adiponectin, insulin and leptin ELISA kit; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). Absorbance from each sample will measured in duplicate using a spectrophotometric microplate reader at wavelength of 450 nm (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).\n\nStatistical Methods MINITAB version 16 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA) will be used to analyze the differences between anthropometric and biochemical parameters and irisin levels; Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) will be used to incorporate the input of data. The results will be expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.), as absolute number or as percentage (%) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Comparisons between groups for the dependent variables will be made using paired Student\u00b4s t-test for means and McNemar test for proportions. For independent variables, the normality will be revised both, graphically and by the Shapiro-Wilk test, and subsequently, the comparisons between groups will be determined using z-test. To assess the association between anthropometric, clinical and biochemical variables and irisin levels, a simple linear regression will be used. The mean comparisons between gender groups will be determined using t-test for independent samples. All tests will be interpreted based on two-tailed hypothesis. The significance level will be set at 0.05 in all cases.",

    "brief_summary": "Premixed insulin-based therapy is a standard insulin treatment strategy in Austria. The widespread use of premixed insulin is explained by high acceptance by health care professionals and patients due to one single product and flexible number of injections (1-3 daily) which covers the demand in controlling fasting and postprandial glucose excursions of most patients with diabetes. However, the use of pre-mixed insulin frequently leads to a high insulin demand and consequently weight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Hence, achieve good metabolic control in these patients remains a major challenge.\n\nFor those patients, the approach to treatment intensification without facing the typical risks of insulin treatment (hypoglycemia and weight increase) is of major importance. One, so far not exploited option may be the BIT-strategy: Basal insulin in combination with incretin-based therapy.\n\nPathophysiologically basal insulin inhibits glucose production in the liver, decreases hepatic insulin resistance and improves the function of beta cells in the postprandial state by discharge of fasting insulin secretion. During further diabetes progression steadily increasing HbA1c levels - despite good fasting blood glucose control - indicate the need for additional intervention of meal-related glucose excursions. In this stage of type-2 diabetes basal insulin can be combined with prandial (short-acting) insulin or prandial GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, regarding important safety parameters: risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain in the long-term treatment GLP-1 receptor agonists are beneficial.\n\nLixisenatide is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist with a pronounced postprandial (PPG) effect which fits with basal insulin mode of action primarily focused on fasting blood glucose reduction.\n\nTherefore 10 patients (both gender) under treatment with premixed insulin (2-3 times daily) and HbA1c\\>7% will be switched to basal insulin glargine (Lantus, once daily) and GLP-1 receptor agonist Lixisenatide (Lyxumia, once daily). The investigators hypothesize that switching from a therapy based on premixed insulin to a simple, once daily administered combination of basal insulin plus a GLP-1 receptor agonist in patients with type-2 diabetes not achieving therapeutic target (HbA1c\\>7%) is clinically feasable in an out patient setting",

    "brief_summary": "The research is devoted to studying the features of the metabolic syndrome in cancer survivors in childhood is supposed to answer the following questions:\n\n* How can metabolic syndrome be diagnosed in the Russian population of survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas?\n* What are the features of the clinical symptoms of metabolic syndrome in this category of patients?\n* Which genetic mutations are found in cancer survivors of patients with metabolic syndrome; Which of these mutations can be considered as protective or vice versa predisposing to the development of metabolic syndromes? Is the metabolic syndrome associated with an increased frequency of toxic complications of therapy during the intensive stages?",
    "detailed_description": "Brief Overview:\n\nThe remarkable progress in developing curative therapy for childhood cancer over the last 4 to 5 decades has increased awareness of the serious cancer treatment-related late effects experienced by long-term survivors such as premature mortality early deaths, second primary cancers, organ dysfunction (heart, lung, endocrine system), fertility impairment, cognitive deficits, and reduced quality of life. Endocrine disorders, which occur in 30% to 70% of childhood cancer survivors, are among the most frequent late effects of anticancer therapy. Survivors treated with radiation and alkylating agent chemotherapy for hematological malignancies and CNS tumors are at a particularly high risk for endocrine dysfunction.\n\nMost anticancer drugs act directly or indirectly by modifying intracellular metabolism. Therefore, high frequency of acute and late cancer treatment-related organ toxicity can result in metabolic disorders. For example, steroid-induced hypercortism blocks glycolysis and results in insulin resistance of tissues. Insulin resistance is associated with earlier manifestation of diabetes mellitus, obesity etc. The clinical sequelae of metabolic syndrome developing in childhood cancer survivors may include insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia, endothelial failure, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, chronic fatigue syndrome, motor and behavioral disorders.\n\nModern genetics make it possible to create a basis for a personalized approach to the prevention of early and late toxic effects caused by anticancer therapy and the rehabilitation of the childhood cancer survivors.\n\nObjectives:\n\nSpecific Aim 1. Evaluate the frequency and clinical features of the metabolic syndrome in childhood cancer survivors.\n\nHypothesis 1A: Components of the metabolic syndrome are realizing in children and adolescents at all stages of therapy of leukemia and lymphomas, can influence the development of complications and late toxic effects.\n\nHypothesis 1B: Initial health conditions (abnormal IBM, family history, comorbid diseases); drug's toxicity could influence to the appearance of early manifestation of metabolic syndrome.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Evaluate the contribution of functional polymorphisms in candidate genes to metabolic syndrome outcomes among childhood cancer patients.\n\nHypothesis 2A: Genetic polymorphisms involved in the regulation of the insulin resistance and cancer medications during treatment contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome in childhood cancer survivors.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Assess the extent to which genetic predictors, doses of drugs, risk factors improve the discriminatory performance of standard clinical prediction models for metabolic syndrome outcomes among childhood cancer survivors.\n\nHypothesis 3 A: Development of metabolic syndrome in cancer patients depends of genetic determinants and toxic effects of antitumor therapy.\n\nSecondary Aim 1: Assess the definition of metabolic syndrome in cohort of patients of leukemia and lymphoma and survivors.\n\nHypothesis 1A: Episodes of triglyceridemic, insulin resistance (Hyperglycemia, HOMA\\>2,7, Steroid Diabetes) during the treatment could be the base evidence marker of Metabolic Syndrome in patients treated by antitumor therapy.\n\nHypothesis 1 B: Endothelial dysfunction as a clinical component of metabolic syndrome is responsible for cardiovascular abnormalities in cancer survivors.\n\nExploratory Aim 1: Assess the association of biomarkers and genetic predictors among childhood cancer survivors with therapeutic exposures (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) and metabolic syndrome.\n\nEvaluation:\n\nEligible persons who consent to participate in this trial will be asked to do the following:\n\n* Vital sign measurement including resting heart rate, blood pressure, height, and weight.\n* A total of 12 mL of blood will be collected in 3 test tubes. Biomarker analysis will be completed by Laboratory of Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center.\n* A Total of 4 mL of blood in 1 test tube will be used for genotyping for the presence of polymorphic variants in genes involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics, insulin resistance and carbohydrate metabolism in the biomolecular laboratory of Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center.\n* An echocardiogram and ultrasound will be performed to assess cardiac function.\n* CAVI and ABI pulse wave velocity will be non-invasively measured by using the SphygmoCor VaSera VS-1500N. Arterial pressure waveforms will be recorded with a strain gauge pressure sensor placed lightly over the radial artery before and after \"6-minutes physical activity\".",

Indeed, overweight and obese people carry a major risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been demonstrated that polyphenols could be used to counteract some of the mechanisms involved in the generation of insulin resistance. The model of overfeeding represents a very good study model of the metabolic complications of obesity, since it has been shown to induce a transient state of insulin resistance in the human.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to study the effects of a overfeeding (+50% of daily caloric needs over 31 days) with or without polyphenols supplementation (2g/days over 31 days) on insulin sensitivity measured in the setting of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and on post prandial partitioning of exogenous lipids after a test meal.\n\nDuring 31 days, the volunteers will consume chocolate bars, chips, chocolate breads and cola in addition to their usual diet and will be supplemented with 2g of grape polyphenols extract or with placebo.",

This omission is despite heart disease being a major cause of death in diabetes. There remains insufficient information on the usefulness of these foods in diabetes. To improve evidence-based guidance for tree nut recommendations, the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review of the effect of tree nuts on diabetes control and features of the metabolic syndrome. The systematic review process allows the combining of the results from many small studies in order to arrive at a pooled estimate, similar to a weighted average, of the true effect. The investigators will be able to explore whether eating tree nuts has different effects between men and women, in different age groups and background disease states, and whether or not the effect of tree nuts depends on the dose and background diet. The findings of this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of Canadians through informing diabetes association recommendations and heart association recommendations where they relate to diabetes.",
    "detailed_description": "Background: Tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts)are an important source of unsaturated fatty acids, vegetable protein, and fibre, as well as minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients. Although the dietary guidelines for Americans and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend the consumption of nuts for cardiovascular risk reduction and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a qualified coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction claim for nuts, none of the diabetes associations have addressed nuts in their most recent recommendations. This omission is despite CHD being a major cause of death in diabetes. Several trials have been undertaken in diabetes, some of which, including the largest to date by our group, have demonstrated advantages in glycemic control. Although the remaining trials have failed to show a significant improvement in glycemic control, the direction of the effect has favored nuts, along with improvements in complementary markers of metabolic control.\n\nNeed for a review: The lack of high quality data in this area to support diabetes recommendations represents an urgent call for stronger evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials remains the \"Gold Standard\" of evidence for nutrition guidelines development.\n\nObjective: To provide evidence-based guidance for diabetes guidelines, we will conduct two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled feeding trials to assess the effect of tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts) on cardiometabolic control: (1) \"Tree nuts and glycemic control\" and (2) \"Tree nuts and features of the metabolic syndrome\".\n\nDesign: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\nData sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms.\n\nStudy selection: Intervention trials that investigate the effect of exchanging nuts for other diets on cardiometabolic risk outcomes in humans will be included. Studies that are \\<3-weeks diet duration, lack a control, or report non-isocaloric comparisons will be excluded.\n\nData extraction: Independent investigators (\u22652) will extract information about study design, sample size, subject characteristics, nut form, dose, follow-up, and the composition of the background diets. Mean\u00b1SEM values will be extracted for all endpoints. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data. Risk of bias and study quality will be assessed using the risk of bias tool and the Heyland Methodological Quality Score (MQS), respectively.\n\nOutcomes: The two proposed analyses will assess a set of outcomes related to a different area of cardiometabolic control: (1) glycemic control (glycated blood proteins\\[HbA1c, fructosamine, glycated albumin\\], fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance \\[HOMA-IR\\]) and (2) harmonized metabolic syndrome features (waist circumference, TG, HDL-C, blood pressure, fasting glucose).\n\nData synthesis: Pooled analyses will be conducted using the Generic Inverse Variance method with random effects models. Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Exceptions will be made for the use of fixed-effects models where there is \\<5 included trials irrespective of heterogeneity or small trials are being pooled with larger more precise trials in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochrane's Q and quantified by I2. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. A priori subgroup analyses will include nut type, nut dose, duration of follow-up, change in saturated fat intake, change in dietary fibre intake, design (crossover, parallel), study quality, and baseline endpoint values. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, level of feeding control \\[metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice\\], washout in crossover trials, energy balance of the background diet, composition of the background diet \\[total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein\\], change in cholesterol intake, change in glycemic index, etc.). Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of subgroups analyses. Publication bias will be investigated by the inspection of funnel plots and application of Egger's and Begg's tests.\n\nKnowledge translation plan: Results from the two systematic reviews and meta-analyses will be disseminated through traditional means such as interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each stage. Two of the applicants (JLS, CWCK) will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines committees the 2013 CDA Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for nutrition therapy by one of the applicants (JLS) and 2015 European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) CPG for nutrition therapy (JLS, CWCK). Target adopters will include the clinical practice, public health, industry, research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide analyses and improve key messages at each stage.\n\nSignificance: The two proposed systematic reviews and meta-analyses will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of tree nuts in diabetes and metabolic syndrome, strengthening the evidence-base for dietary recommendations and health claims.",

Insulin sensitivity is inversely related to body mass index and body fat. Insulin resistance can be defined as impairment of the normal biological response to both endogenous and exogenous insulin. One of the primary defects underlying the development of type 2 diabetes is thought to be insulin resistance. So, it is present in 85% of these patients with Type 2 DM. It is also related to the pathogenesis of many illnesses which includes coronary heart disease, and hypertension\\[3\\] Early detection of insulin resistance (IR) is important to prevent the development of cardiometabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease. The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index, which has high sensitivity and specificity, has been shown to be more useful in estimating the risk of insulin resistance, instead of more invasive, complex, and expensive direct tests such as pancreatic suppression test and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp technique \\[4\\] HOMA-IR is an approved method for evaluating insulin resistance using fasting glucose and insulin levels and is widely used in clinical practice \\[5\\].\n\nTriglyceride glucose (TyG) index is a novel marker, which has been demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity in identifying insulin resistance \\[6\\].\n\nRecently, the use of the triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, a product of fasting glucose and triglyceride are more easily accessible assessment tools both at the outpatient clinics and at the community level, and are low cost \\[7\\].",

The investigators will determine whether impaired insulin-induced suppression of lipolysis (as measured by IC50) is related to the above mentioned lipolysis proteins in groups of volunteers known to vary widely with regards to abdominal adipocyte size and regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis.\n2. The investigators will determine whether the improved insulin regulation of lipolysis resulting from treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone, with or without weight loss, can be linked to specific changes in sets of PPAR\u03b3-responsive adipocyte lipolysis proteins in UBO adults.",

For those randomized to integrated care, subjects will attend one education session weekly at the time of their HIV clinic. During these sessions, subjects will receive contemporaneous HIV clinic appointments (monthly), case management (monthly), drug counseling (twice monthly), and buprenorphine (which will be dispensed weekly.) For those randomized to separate care, subjects will attend HIV clinic appointments monthly, and will attend weekly education sessions at the OASIS facility. During these sessions, subjects will receive weekly buprenorphine, twice monthly drug counseling, and monthly case management.\n\nWe will measure outcomes by reporting attendance, CD4 counts, HIV viral loads, urine toxicology testing on at least a quarterly basis. We will also measure patient satisfaction, knowledge, quality of life, and a number of other outcomes.",

    "brief_summary": "When patients are dying they become unable to take oral medication and if they develop symptoms (e.g. pain or agitation) they need to be given a subcutaneous injection of medication. If they are at home this requires that a District Nurse is called and it can take a long time (sometimes hours) for the Nurse to arrive. This can be a very stressful time for the patient and family.\n\nThere are 2 drug preparations which could potentially be given by family members in the home:\n\nNasal fentanyl (PecFent) Buccal midazolam (Epistatus) If these preparations helped symptoms this would give much quicker symptom control for patients and might mean the District Nurse visit was not needed.\n\nIn advance of a community based randomised trial of these modes of administration, it is important to assess the feasibility of such an approach in terms of carer acceptability and patient tolerability as well as determine appropriate sample sizes and sampling methods. There are 2 work packages which would help assess feasibility of a community trial:\n\n1. An open label randomised controlled trial comparing the use of PecFent with or without Epistatus versus standard subcutaneous breakthrough medication for the management of breakthrough pain (with or without agitation) in dying hospice patients who either remain in the hospice or go home.\n2. A qualitative interview study to capture the thoughts of relatives of these patients about the use of these preparations.",
    "detailed_description": "This will be an open-label, randomized, controlled feasibility pilot study to evaluate whether using nasal fentanyl (PecFent: 100, 200, 400 or 800 mcg) alone or in combination with buccal midazolam (Epistatus: 2.5, 5 or 10 mg) has the possibility to give better breakthrough symptom control to dying patients when compared with standard subcutaneous medication (Figure 1 A and B).\n\nEach subject and their carers/family members will receive verbal and written information followed by signing of the Informed Consent Forms (ICFs). The study is divided into two arms. In both arms patients will receive standard regular oral or subcutaneous medication for relieving non-breakthrough symptoms. In the standard care arm, patients will receive standard as needed medication (SANM) administered orally, sublingually or subcutaneously for breakthrough symptoms. The experimental arm will consist of two stages: in Stage 1 of the study, PecFent will be given to patients in order to treat breakthrough pain instead of subcutaneous opioids. PecFent will be titrated in order to establish an effective treatment dose to manage pain. SANM administered orally, sublingually or subcutaneously will be used to treat agitation and other symptoms.\n\nAfter the effective treatment dose of PecFent has been established patients will enter stage 2. Patients will not move to stage 2 if the treatment dose of PecFent is not deemed effective. Stage 2 will test a range of doses of Epistatus in terms of efficacy in treating agitation alone instead of subcutaneous midazolam (or in combination with the effective treatment dose of PecFent for pain and agitation).\n\nSANM will be used to treat other symptoms. Assessment of effectiveness of any as needed medication will be conducted at 30 minutes from administration. If PecFent, Epistatus or a combination of both is ineffective, administration of SANM will be considered. Further opioid cannot be given within one hour but benzodiazepine can be given within 30 minutes as is standard practice in this setting. Thus, patients in the experimental arm will receive symptom relief regardless the efficacy of test drugs.",

Randomization will be stratified by study site and prior antiretroviral exposure. Two hundred participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 self-administered antiretroviral therapy (SAT) or directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART). Subjects assigned to DAART will take morning doses of antiretroviral therapy with a nurse or medical assistant in a private room at the OTP. DAART subjects will be transferred to self-administered therapy after 12 months. This is a 5 year study and participants will be enrolled between month 6 and month 42 of the study. The maximum follow-up for individual participants will be 18 months. Based on our pilot experience we anticipate 50% of subjects will be women, 80% African American, with a median age of 44 years. The following outcomes will be compared in the two study arms:\n\n* Suppression of the viral load (primary outcome)\n* Changes in CD4+ cell counts\n* The development of antiretroviral drug resistance\n* Retention to opioid agonist maintenance therapy, urine toxicology screens for drugs of abuse, and self-reported drug and alcohol use\n* Self-reported adherence with therapy, retention to ART, and clinical and psychosocial moderators of adherence\n* Electronically monitored medication adherence, using MEMS caps, in the first 2 months of the study\n\nOutcomes data will be obtained at study assessment visits at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. Participants will provide contact information, take an interviewer-administered survey, and provide blood and urine samples at study assessment visits.

Despite this, substance abuse treatment has traditionally been based on an acute care model. The field needs an addiction management model for drug-dependent patients, which, like disease management for other chronic conditions, provides: 1) initial stabilization; 2) ongoing treatment to maintain clinical gains; 3) monitoring of patient symptoms; and 4) adjustments to the treatment based on the patient's response.\n\nIn response to these needs we have developed the Long Term Recovery Management (LTRM) model. LTRM is predicated on initiating long-term addiction management at the onset of substance abuse treatment, extending the length of treatment, expediting the transitions between intensive treatment and maintenance of behavioral change, adapting treatment intensity to patient's response to treatment, and actively facilitating the therapeutic alliance. LTRM combines 3 established treatment techniques (Community Reinforcement Approach, Contingency Management, and Facilitated Therapeutic Alliance), each with demonstrated efficacy, into a chronic disease model. In addition, patient cases are kept open, thereby removing potential obstacles to re-engagement with stepped-up care, when indicated. The LTRM model emphasizes: engagement in continuous long-term treatment and recovery support, therapeutic alliance, and early re-intervention as the main mechanisms for maintenance of behavioral change.",

    "brief_summary": "Heroin dependence is one of most common substance dependence, which brings great burden on health worldwide. Heroin dependence may lead to immunosuppression and cognitive impairments. Once heroin dependence is developed, it will be difficult to recover and easy to relapse. Although many efforts had been made in the treatment of heroin dependence, the annual recurrence of heroin dependence with traditional therapies would be up to 90%. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) each alone was reported to have some effect on preventing from relapse of substance dependence. In order to test whether combined therapy of high frequency rTMS (hf-rTMS) with CBT is better for preventing from relapse of heroin dependence, we recruit patients with heroin dependence to participate this study. The study is a factorial designed and the patients will be assigned into one of the following six groups randomly: (1) regular treatment (symptomatic treatment) with blank TMS; (2) regular treatment (RT) with blank TMS and CBT; (3) RT with right DLPFC hf-rTMS; (4) RT with right DLPFC hf-rTMS and CBT; (5) RT with left DLPFC hf-rTMS; (6) RT with left DLPFC hf-rTMS and CBT. TMS was given 5 days per week for total 2 weeks using uniform scheme (5 seconds of 10Hz stimulation per train, 30 trains per day with inter-train interval of 20 seconds). CBT will be given once per week for total 8 weeks. The patients will be followed up for 6 months. Recurrence of heroin dependence, duration of abstention, heroin/drug intake, craving for heroin and other cognitive psychological assessments will be recorded and compared among the 6 treatment groups and the efficacy of combined therapy of rTMS with CBT will be evaluated in our study.",

    "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n\\- The treatment of addiction often hinges on preventing relapse into drug-using behaviors, which occurs at high rates even after prolonged abstinence. Some methadone patients continue to abuse cocaine and heroin during treatment, even with extensive psychosocial services. More research is needed to look at the results from earlier studies of continued drug use during methadone treatment, focusing on the results of fixed vs. flexible doses of methadone to reduce the likelihood of continued drug use and the role of monetary vouchers as an incentive to continue abstinence from illicit substances.\n\nObjectives:\n\n\\- To determine if the combination of flexible methadone dosing and voucher-based contingency management can improve rates of abstinence from heroin and cocaine.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age or older who are dependent on opioids (cocaine and/or heroin).\n\nDesign:\n\n* The study will last 40 weeks. After the initial screening, participants will receive daily methadone and weekly drug counseling sessions that will continue throughout the study.\n* After 6 weeks of methadone treatment, participants who continue to use heroin and cocaine will be randomized to one of four groups for 16 weeks of study. Each group will receive a flexible or fixed dose of methadone, and one of two contingency management conditions.\n* Flexible-dose participants will receive individualized dose increases, based on drug use and withdrawal. Fixed-dose participants will be set at a specific dose of methadone that will not be changed.\n* The two contingency management conditions will be monetary vouchers given for regular cocaine-negative urine samples, or vouchers independent of urine cocaine screen results.\n* After the study phase, participants will have 10 weeks of standard individual counseling and stable doses of methadone. Urine samples will continue to be collected, but no vouchers will be given.\n* At the end of the study, participants will have the choice of transferring to a community clinic or undergoing a 10-week taper from methadone.",
    "detailed_description": "Scientific goals. The primary goal is to determine if simultaneous abstinence from heroin and cocaine can be elicited by combining two approaches: flexible methadone dosing and voucher-based CM. Secondary goals include: 1) comparing saliva and plasma levels of methadone, cortisol, and prolactin as predictors of treatment outcome; and 2) evaluating the impact of methadone maintenance on renal function, lipid profile, and cardiac function.\n\nMethods. During an initial 6-week baseline phase, cocaine-abusing opioid-dependent outpatient participants (300 enrolled; 180 evaluable) will be stabilized on methadone 70 mg/day. At the end of baseline, participants who continue to use heroin and cocaine will be randomized to one of two dosing regimens and one of two CM conditions. In the flexible-dose regimen, participants will receive individualized dose increases (15 mg/day) to a maximum of 190 mg /day, based on heroin use and withdrawal. In the fixed-dose regimen, participants methadone dose will be increased to 100 mg/day and remain fixed there. Dose-group assignment will be double-blind: investigators will determine participants individualized dose increases, but only the pharmacists will know which participants actually receive them. The two CM conditions will be: vouchers contingent on cocaine-negative urine specimens, or noncontingent vouchers (i.e., vouchers independent of urine cocaine screen results). The main outcome measure will be the percentage of urines simultaneously negative for both cocaine and illicit opiates during treatment. For the concurrently run pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic portion, saliva and blood samples will be taken at regular intervals to determine levels of methadone, cortisol, and prolactin as predictors of treatment outcome. For the concurrently run medical-outcomes portion, urine (renal function), blood (lipid profile), and ECGs (cardiac function),will be obtained at set intervals.\n\nHypothesis. Flexible methadone dosing and voucher-based CM will be safe and result in greater simultaneous abstinence from heroin and cocaine, higher treatment retention, and higher health-related QOL when compared to fixed methadone dosing and the absence of CM.\n\nBenefits. Participants will receive methadone, counseling, and some medical care at no charge. The methadone and voucher interventions are likely to reduce participants' use of heroin and cocaine. Counseling will include management of HIV risk behaviors. The study incorporates participant safety monitoring and will provide information relevant to improving the health and safety of community methadone-maintenance patients. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic part of the study does not benefit participants directly, but may lead to the development of more useful and less invasive drug-monitoring methods.\n\nRisks. Participants may experience side effects from methadone, discomfort during methadone withdrawal, and discomfort (or, rarely syncope) from blood draws.",

Administration of naloxone via the nose (intranasal) has been suggested as an alternative for use by emergency teams and possibly also bystanders. This is not only an easier way to give naloxone, but would also eliminate the risk for needle stick injuries and blood contamination. In a series of studies on intranasal naloxone at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, this study explores pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in healthy volunteers under the influence of remifentanil.",
    "detailed_description": "Healthy volunteers will be brought into a state of opioid influence in a well-known, short acting, controlled and safe manner using remifentanil.\n\nNaloxone is a well-known, well-tolerated drug with an excellent safety profile over many decades of use. The current formulation has proven safe and without local or systemic side effects in the studies conducted so far. The excipients in the present nasal formulation are all well known.\n\nThis study has two aims. Firstly to investigate what naloxone does to the body under opioid influence, applying a well-tested model with infusion of the potent opioid remifentanil (Target Control Infusion). This will create a state of strong opioid effect for a short time and in a highly controlled fashion, inducing a state of miosis, reduced respiratory rate and reduced sensation to pain, all three strong indicators of opiates. Naloxone will antagonise these effects, and this change can be measured. Choosing intramuscular 0.8 mg naloxone for comparison means that the novel intranasal naloxone formulation will be compared with the well-established and described treatment protocol for opioid overdose in Norway used today.\n\nSecondly the pharmacokinetic profile of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone will be studied. The same measurements as in preparative studies (OPI 12-001 and OPI 13-001) will be taken: Serum naloxone concentration over time to calculate maximum concentration, Time to maximum concentration, Area Under the Curve and Relative bioavailability. There are two main reasons to repeat these measurements. In contrast to the previous studies under the current protocol the participants will be under the influence by strong opioids. This may have significant physiologic effects, and it will be explored whether the pharmacokinetics of the intranasal formulation are changed. The other reason is that in this study pharmacokinetics of naloxone will be compared with the actual dosage and administration routes of naloxone as used by doctors and paramedics in the pre-hospital setting. This has not been done before, in spite of the widespread use of this treatment, The measurements of remifentanil in serum open the possibility to relate pharmacodynamic data directly to an actual serum concentration of the opioid at the same time.\n\nCare will be taken not to include opioid users in this study as naloxone would precipitate acute withdrawal. Also possible drug misusers will be excluded as well as people who have access to remifentanil and infusion equipment in their daily work, although the abuse potential of this highly specialised drug is minimal.\n\nSafety of the formulation will also be studied by measuring vital signs and for the patient to report any nasal discomfort or potential adverse reactions during the study.\n\nBy weighing spray device, and intramuscular syringes before and after discharge the reliability of the dose delivered will be confirmed.",

    "brief_summary": "Chronic drug addiction is not only associated with increased mental health symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, but also with brain (neural and cognitive) deficits. These neurocognitive deficits (NCDs) in memory, attention, decision-making, self-control and judgement disturb normal daily functioning and attempts for abstinence. These NCDs are also associated with worse long-term treatment outcomes. Current treatment programs for addiction to opioids and amphetamines are mainly focused on abstinence from illicit drugs with or without assistance of medications, with the assumption that these NCDs will subsequently heal. However, NCDs are found to persist even after a long-term abstinence and are thought to contribute to relapse, decreases quality of life, or lack of reintegration into society. Furthermore, NCDs (particularly related to attention and memory) are considered a potential obstacle for engagement in therapy services for addiction and associated mood, anxiety and trauma-related comorbidities (i.e., cognitive-behavioral therapies). Brain rehabilitation programs focused on compensatory strategies and training exercises for NCDs associated with traumatic brain injuries, stroke, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia has consistently been found to improve functioning and long-term outcomes for these populations. There have been a few preliminary attempts to transplant cognitive rehabilitation with substance use populations, with some limited promise. However, these previous studies failed to link cognitive strategies with the drug use and affective/craving symptoms experienced by patients and also did not fully incorporate knowledge gained from neuroscientific research on opioid and/or methamphetamine addiction specifically.\n\nThe aim of this study is to characterize clinical efficacy for an intervention targeting NCDs in opioid and/or methamphetamine addiction by enhancing awareness and use of neurocognitive skills in the context of substance use recovery. This aim will be accomplished by randomizing 80 subjects with opioid and/or methamphetamine use disorder who are already enrolled in substance use treatment in the state of Oklahoma to also complete a novel \"Neurocognitive Empowerment for Addiction Treatment\" (NEAT) program developed by a group of investigators at Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma. NEAT will be novel in (a) its use of cartoons, brain awareness games and real-life scenarios to ensure it is interactive and engaging, (b) the focus on the role of neurocognitive deficits in recovery from substance use and co-occurring mental health symptomatology, and (c) its incorporation of neuroscientific findings specific to substance use to the training and exercise strategies. Subjects will be followed up for twelve months after starting the program with different measures for addiction and mental health recovery to explore the efficacy of NEAT compared to the control intervention. Using LIBR's cutting-edge neuroimaging facilities before and after interventions, this study has the unique opportunity to monitor not only clinical outcomes but also potential changes NEAT may have on brain structure and function. In case of finding reasonable clinical efficacy for NEAT, it will be hopefully integrated as a manualized brain rehabilitation program to the substance use treatment programs.",

    "detailed_description": "Study Design A significant cause of mortality among opioid users is overdose, which commonly occurs following voluntary (opioid detoxification) or involuntary (incarceration) opioid abstinence. For the purposes of the current application, opioid overdose is defined as use of an opioid in an amount that results in over-sedation and/or respiratory depression requiring intervention by medical or non-medical persons. Nearly 85% of overdoses occur in the presence of a witness. Common methods of intervention by individuals without medical training are ineffective techniques such as shaking the victim or injecting salt water. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that has long been used successfully by trained medical personnel during emergency resuscitation following opioid overdose. In an effort to reduce fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, a number of states are implementing programs in which non-medical personnel are provided brief instruction in recognizing the signs of opioid overdose and administering naloxone. However, most of the existing programs are not designed to collect empirical data on the safety and effectiveness of this intervention. Reporting of naloxone use is voluntary and without incentive, and the experience of those who have been trained and prescribed naloxone is not followed.\n\nThe proposed investigation will be one of the first large-scale, prospective attempts to obtain data on the effectiveness of naloxone distribution among opioid-abusing populations at high risk of unintentional opioid poisoning. Specifically, opioid abusers will be recruited from drug detoxification sites as well as those accessing services at needle exchange programs. All participants (N=700) will receive the standard opioid overdose education and naloxone. One third of the participants will be randomized to receive additional in-depth psychosocial education focusing on recognition and prevention of opioid overdose, and appropriate use of naloxone. Another third of the participants will receive the extensive training and be required to engage a spouse, partner, relative, or friend in this supplementary intervention. We plan to randomize individuals to each group \\[Treatment as Usual (TAU) vs. Extensively Trained (ET) vs. Extensively Trained with a Significant Other (ETwSO)\\] and, through continued follow up over one year, we will compare self-reported overdose reversal attempts (with and without naloxone use), naloxone-related adverse events, and changes in patterns of heroin and other drug use. In addition to comparing outcome variables in the TAU, ET and ETwSO groups prospectively, we will analyze data collected before study initiation to compare fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in neighborhoods with facilities that offer overdose prevention training and naloxone to those that do not, using data provided by our collaborators at the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).\n\nSpecific Aims and Hypotheses\n\n* Primary Aim (Prospective Study): Determine the extent to which additional psychosocial intervention can improve the effectiveness of current overdose prevention training as measured by:\n* increased frequency of naloxone use (ETwSO \\> ET \\> TAU)\n* decreased number of opioid overdoses (ETwSO \\< ET \\< TAU)\n* improved recognition of opioid overdose and naloxone indication knowledge (increased BORRA scores; ETwSO \\> ET \\> TAU)\n* Secondary Aim (Prospective Study): Determine the potential harms of this novel naloxone-prescribing practice as measured by:\n* proportion of participants calling 911 in response to an overdose, compared to participants' recent history of calling 911 in response to an overdose\n* risky drug use behavior (e.g. increased heroin/prescription opioid use, increased use of illicit drug combinations) following training, compared to pre-training\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nPrimary Outcome Measures (Prospective Study): Determine the extent to which additional psychosocial intervention can improve upon the effectiveness of current overdose prevention training by: 1) increasing the frequency of naloxone use among ET participants (continuous variable); 2) decreasing the number of lethal opioid overdoses witnessed and experienced by the ET group (continuous variable); 3) improving accurate recognition of opioid overdose and naloxone indication knowledge (increased Brief Overdose Recognition and Response Assessment (BORRA) score among ET participants (continuous variable). These variables will be assessed repeatedly over the course of 1 year at: baseline (BL), immediately post-training (T0), 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months (T1, T3, T6, and T12). The frequency of naloxone use and outcomes of the overdose reversal attempts will be measured at T1, T3, T6, and T12 only.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures (Prospective Study): Evaluate the potential harms of this novel naloxone-prescribing practice as assessed by: 1) decreased proportion of 911 calls in response to an overdose, compared to participants' previous history of calling 911 while witnessing an overdose (continuous variable); 2) changes in the use of illicit opioids, other illegal drugs, or drug combinations following training (longitudinal continuous variable); 3) prevalence of adverse events related to naloxone administration by non-medical personnel (continuous variable).",

    "detailed_description": "American Indians and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people experience striking disparities in mortality from cardiovascular disease compared to the general U.S. population. Among women of childbearing age, early detection of chronic diseases can be missed because the type of medical care they seek is typically focused on their reproductive health care needs. Yet, chronic disease risk factors, such as smoking and obesity, are common in this age group and can be treated with evidence-based interventions.\n\nThe investigators of this study propose to implement a contingency management (CM) intervention that uses gift cards, and prizes to reinforce smoking cessation and weight loss. CM has been used successfully for a range of addictive behaviors, including cigarette smoking and heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and other illicit substance use, as well as for reducing psychiatric problems and HIV risk. CM is understudied in the treatment of obesity, and in AI/AN populations but has great potential for treating smoking and overweight/obesity, as it reinforces both short- and long-term behaviors. This is important because both smoking cessation and weight loss are highly prone to short-term relapse, whereas a longer duration of the desired behaviors is associated with greater success in adopting permanent lifestyle change. The investigators will perform a randomized, controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial design to evaluate a 16-week culturally-tailored CM intervention that promotes cigarette cessation and weight loss among overweight/obese AI/AN women who are current smokers. Participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) CM for smoking abstinence, 2) CM for weight loss, 3) CM for both, or 4) a non-contingent control group that will not receive CM for either behavior. The specific aims are to:\n\n1. Quantify the prevalence of overweight/obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes and/or elevated fasting blood glucose, and depression and anxiety among women of reproductive age (18-44 years) who are patients at a clinic that primarily serves AI/AN people;\n2. Determine if women randomized to CM conditions more often quit or reduce smoking and lose weight compared to those in the control group;\n3. Determine if the intervention is disproportionately effective for women receiving CM for both smoking abstinence and weight loss, compared to the single-behavior CM groups or the control group;\n4. Quantify group differences in secondary cardiovascular disease risk factors after completing the various CM interventions.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW The CM intervention is 16 weeks long and consists of four groups: 1) CM for smoking abstinence, 2) CM for weight loss, 3) CM for both, or 4) a control group that will not receive CM for either behavior. Participants will be asked to go into the clinic twice a week for 16 weeks during the intervention period, and will be asked to complete a baseline visit at the beginning of the study and three follow-up visits one month apart after the intervention is completed (weeks 20, 24, and 28). In each intervention session the women participants will complete a urine test to determine if they have smoked a cigarette within the past 3-4 days, and will be weighed on a dedicated, standardized scale. Other clinical measurements and self -reported outcomes will be collected as well.",

As a result there is evidence in the literature of increasing interest in alternative techniques such as intrathecal anaesthesia or continuous wound infusion of local anaesthetic, however nobody has examined the effect of combining the techniques or their impact on the surgical stress response.\n\nWe intend to compare patients undergoing major resections for colorectal cancer receiving intrathecal anaesthesia in combination with a wound infusion of local anaesthetic with those receiving a continuous wound infusion alone. We will examine the surgical stress response and postoperative pain control in addition to objective measures of postoperative recovery.\n\nWe suggest that our approach will attenuate the surgical stress response and provide optimal pain control that will ultimately translate in improved recovery and outcome following surgery for colorectal cancer.",

    "detailed_description": "Heroin and injection drug use (IDU) are highly prevalent and driving the HIV epidemic in Malaysia and other countries in the region. In our original RCT, buprenorphine was superior to naltrexone and placebo in treatment retention, weeks of consecutive abstinence and time to heroin use. However, there is room for improvement, since only 50% of subjects assigned to buprenorphine and counseling remained in treatment for 6 months; only 28% avoided relapse to heroin; and treatment reduced drug- but not sex-related HIV risk behaviors. In actual clinical practice in Malaysia and the U.S. buprenorphine treatment effectiveness may be even less, because buprenorphine is provided with relatively minimal psychosocial services (often brief physician management (PM) alone, without additional counseling), and without additional behavioral interventions or contingency management. Hence, we propose a follow up study to evaluate whether standard buprenorphine treatment (consisting of buprenorphine provision, PM, and non-contingent provision of take-home doses of buprenorphine, NCB) is sufficient or whether one or a combination of two behavioral treatments--behavioral drug and HIV risk reduction counseling (BDRC) or abstinence-contingent take-home buprenorphine (ACB)-improve its efficacy. BDRC utilizes short-term behavioral contracts to promote abstinence and reduce drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors and can be provided by nurses and medical assistants available in medical settings in Malaysia. ACB, a low cost and feasible alternative to non-contingent take-home buprenorphine (NCB), retains many of its advantages--abstinent patients manage their medication supplies outside of the clinic--but ACB also provides positive incentives for abstinence and directly observed buprenorphine for those with continuing heroin use. In the proposed 2X2 study, heroin dependent patients (N=240) will be inducted onto buprenorphine (weeks 1-2) and then randomized to PM with NCB, PM with ACB, PM with BDRC and NCB, or PM with BDRC and ACB (weeks 3-26). Primary outcome measures include reductions in heroin use (percent days abstinent, proportion of opiate-negative urine tests) and reductions in drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors. Data analyses will focus on the intention-to treat sample. The study results will inform practice guidelines and policies regarding buprenorphine treatment.",

    "detailed_description": "Rationale: Once Suboxone becomes available for widespread clinical use, it is anticipated that opioid-dependent patients seeking treatment with buprenorphine will be placed directly onto Suboxone. Two strategies that have had good success for inducting patients onto Suboxone have been developed: 1) a \"bridging\" procedure in which patients initiate therapy with Subutex and then transfer to Suboxone, and 2) a direct Suboxone induction procedure. However, there have been no controlled studies of direct Suboxone induction, and it is not clear whether using a Subutex-to-Suboxone induction procedure would produce any added clinical benefit for the patient relative to direct Suboxone induction.\n\nThis study addresses a post-marketing commitment to the European Medicines Agency to conduct a prospective, controlled study of induction with Suboxone. Using a prospective, randomized, active-drug-controlled, double-blind and double-dummy design, this study will assess the acceptability and safety of Suboxone in heroin users by comparing the clinical response of participants who are inducted directly onto Suboxone with that of participants who are inducted first to Subutex and then transferred to Suboxone. The dose regimen used during the induction phase of this study is identical to that used in the pivotal efficacy study comparing Suboxone and Subutex (Fudala et al, 2003), which is included in the Suboxone Summary of Product Characteristics. The data collected in this study will include information on the extent of opioid use before treatment initiation.\n\nTwo strategies for inducting opioid-dependent patients using short-acting opioids (eg, heroin) onto Suboxone have emerged from published US studies. One involves using Subutex to \"bridge\" the transition to Suboxone by using Subutex over the first 2 days before transferring directly to Suboxone on the third day. The other involves direct Suboxone induction, in which patients receive Suboxone as the initial dose followed by continued rapid Suboxone dose titration.\n\nIn the pivotal efficacy study, opiate-dependent heroin users assigned to either Subutex or Suboxone groups received an induction dose of 8 mg of Subutex (administered as a single 8-mg tablet) on Day 1 and 16 mg of Subutex (administered as two 8-mg tablets) on Day 2. The 109 participants assigned to Suboxone received 16 mg of Suboxone (administered as two 8-mg tablets) on Day 3, and the 105 participants assigned to Subutex received 16 mg of Subutex (administered as two 8-mg tablets) on Day 3. The induction schedule used in the pivotal trial, in which a Subutex-to-Suboxone bridging procedure was used, was successful for inducting heroin-dependent patients onto Suboxone, achieving good compliance and resulting in relatively few AEs accounting for treatment discontinuation.\n\nOverall, several large-scale studies using Suboxone as an initial medication have been conducted with good results, and it appears clear that, as was the case in the pivotal study, most patients safely tolerate a total dose of at least 8 mg on the first day of treatment. However, as these studies were not controlled, it remains unclear whether using a Subutex-to-Suboxone induction procedure would produce any added clinical benefit to the patient relative to a direct Suboxone induction procedure. Furthermore, there have been no studies of direct Suboxone induction outside of the United States.",

The annual death toll from overdose is about 250, twice the annual death toll from traffic accidents. Those who inject heroin or other opioids are considered to have the highest risk for death from overdose. To save lives, immediate treatment with a \u03bc-opioid antidote such as naloxone is required. Usually naloxone is injected into a muscle or a blood vessel. Administration of naloxone via the nose has been suggested as an alternative for use by emergency teams and possibly also bystanders. This is not only an easier way to give naloxone, but would also eliminate the risk for needle stick injuries and blood contamination. A pilot study in this hospital has shown no significant side effects or adverse reaction. While significant benefits are expected from developing an adequately formulated naloxone nasal spray for pre-hospital use, the risks to participants are minimal. Therefore this preclinical study in healthy volunteers will be undertaken.",

    "detailed_description": "Opioid dependence is a severe public health problem. Current efforts to taper individuals off opioid medications are limited due to a high relapse rate and lack of efficacy in relieving subjective symptoms. Methadone substitution therapies might decrease the criminal rate and increase the quality of life for individuals with opioid dependence, but the high drop-out rate and continuing use of methadone are major problems in the maintenance of therapy for opioid dependence. Studies in the pathogenesis of opioid dependence and additional behaviors need more focused attention.\n\nDextromethorphan (DM) is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has proven safety record for anti-tussive purpose. Previous studies demonstrated that DM may be useful in decreasing craving in animals (Huang, et al., 2003; Lue et al., 2007) and withdrawal tendencies in human with opioid dependence. In recent studies, DM has been reported to afford neuroprotection against endotoxin-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity (Li et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2004, 2005) which might be related to treatment for additictive behaviors. The purposes of this study are to examine whether DM is able to 1) reduce opioid tolerance and decrease methadone use; 2) reduce withdrawal symptoms; 3) decrease the relapse rate of opioid use, and 4) be an effective treatment for opioid dependence (and addictive behaviors).\n\nThis is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, and parallel groups clinical research trial study. Subjects with opioid dependence are recruited from two different sources. One group will come from the list of current opioid users and will be required to stay on methadone treatment (opioid using group), and the second group will come from subjects who are forced to discontinue opioid use for more than one week (opioid free group).\n\nIn the opioid using group, add-on of DM or placebo treatment will proceed in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks after completed structured diagnostic interview and adjusted methadone dose. In the opioid free group, subjects will take one-week placebo for the wash-out period first and then will be admitted into a double-blind DM/placebo only for 12 weeks. Both opioid using and opioid free groups will be examined weekly through urine tests for opioid use and will be assessed on a craving scale after the completion of the structured diagnostic interviews. We will measure the treatment response and side effects to clarify the curative effects of DM with the use of the double-blinded DM/placebo therapy design in both the opioid using and opioid free groups. Several psychological examinations, psychosocial questionnaires, tests for immune parameters, electrophysiological studies and genetic markers will be performed in this study. The interim analysis and decording of partial subjects who completed DM/placebo add-on treatment for three months will be performed in the end of first year.",

    "detailed_description": "Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/naloxone each are used to treat opioid use disorders in pregnancy.\n\nBuprenorphine has many preferential characteristics over methadone including decreased risk of maternal overdose, lower incidence of preterm labor, less frequent clinical visits, shorter duration of neonatal hospital stay and treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome. Recent studies have found that increasing the dosing frequencies of buprenorphine is more efficacious to prevent maternal withdrawal symptoms, improve compliance, and theoretically produce better pregnancy outcomes.\n\nBuprenorphine/naloxone, a combination opioid of buprenorphine and naloxone, has also been investigated as an alternative to treatment and maintenance for opioid use disorder. The advantage of the combination of buprenorphine with naloxone is that it reduces the potential for abuse. As a partial mu opioid agonist, buprenorphine alone has the capacity to induce typical opioid effects such as euphoria, which are enhanced when the drug is taken intravenously. By combining buprenorphine with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, the capacity for buprenorphine to be abused is reduced.",

    "detailed_description": "Heroin abusers also frequently abuse cocaine, and concurrent use of these drugs is associated with more severe drug dependence and associated psychiatric and medical problems, greater risk for HIV infection, worse drug abuse treatment outcome, and creates a public health burden. New methods and solutions are needed for this problem.\n\nWhile human laboratory models exist to study choice of cocaine or opioids individually, studies have not examined choice of cocaine alone or cocaine/opioid combinations by heroin dependent individuals, nor have there been interventions to reduce such drug use. We recently developed a sensitive laboratory-based choice progressive ratio procedure to study drug-seeking behavior for opioids. This study will extend this procedure, in the form of drug combination vs. money choices, to obtain a novel human laboratory model of cocaine/opioid abuse. The purpose of this study is to determine whether maintenance on different doses of sustained release d-amphetamine (SR-AMP) combined with constant-dose buprenorphine (BUP) is safe and well tolerated and decreases self-administration of cocaine alone or combined with HYD. Secondary aims are to determine whether SR-AMP attenuates the subjective and physiological effects of cocaine during drug sampling periods prior to choice opportunities.\n\nOne goal of this new study is to develop a human laboratory model of polydrug abuse by allowing participants (who abuse both heroin and cocaine) to choose between drug combinations or money. The second goal of this study is to develop medication treatments to reduce cocaine use by opioid dependent individuals.\n\nParticipants in this observational study will take part in multiple trials in which they have the opportunity to choose between drug combinations (cocaine alone or combined with HYD; relative to HYD alone and dual placebo) or money. On the morning of each session, prior to the choice procedure, participants will receive a sample of the drug dose that can be chosen. Participants will be asked to attend to the effects produced by the drug combination because they will be able to choose this relative to money in the choice task in the afternoon session. During the choice procedure, participants will have 12 opportunities to choose either drug or money. Participants will use a computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout the study. Self-report questionnaires will be completed at different times during the study. Participants will be maintained on a constant dose of BUP throughout the study, with a minimum 2-week lead before the experiment, and a fixed 3-week detoxification after study completion. During the experiment they will be maintained on different doses of SR-AMP and on a constant dose of BUP.",

Evidence-based counseling that is efficacious in reducing HIV risks and drug use and is feasible to provide with MMT will greatly improve the public health benefits of disseminating MMT in China and elsewhere in the world.",
    "detailed_description": "China currently has 1.2 to 3.5 million heroin users (50% with current injection drug use, IDU), and more than 650,000 HIV infected individuals, with 75,000 new infections each year and the majority of HIV infections attributable to IDU. The Chinese government recently embarked on an ambitious program to make methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) widely available to all heroin addicts. By the end of 2008, approximately 560 methadone maintenance treatment clinics had been established, providing treatment to an estimated 166,000 heroin users. However, the current methadone programs provide limited or no drug counseling, and, despite considerable initial promise, many patients continue drug use and risky behaviors while still in MMT or discontinue treatment prematurely. In addition to risky injecting practices, drug users in China also commonly engage in risky sexual practices. Most of China's drug users are young, unmarried, sexually active and only a small fraction report consistent condom use. Their knowledge about HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and blood borne viruses is very poor. The combination of poor knowledge and frequent engagement in high-risk behaviors increases their own risk of infections, and also contributes significantly to the spread of HIV into the general population. \\[Consequently, we propose a randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of MMT combined with one of three manual-guided counseling approaches, Behavioral Drug and HIV Risk Reduction Counseling (BDRC), Educational Counseling (EC), and counseling approximating what is provided as treatment as usual (TAU) in China. Efficacy will be evaluated with regard to our primary outcome measures: reduction of drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors, reduction of frequency of heroin or other illicit opiate use, and duration of opiate abstinence. The study will also evaluate treatment effects on secondary outcome measures (including treatment retention, reductions in other illicit drug use, and improvements of functional status of MMT patients) and incremental resource utilization associated with BDRC, EC and TAU. In preliminary work, we have developed and pilot tested Mandarin versions of the BDRC manual, BDRC and EC training materials, and assessment instruments. Treatment seeking volunteers(N=300) entering MMT will be randomly assigned to 4 months of treatment with one of the three manual-guided treatments. A standard methadone induction and dosing protocol will be used for all subjects to ensure comparable methadone dosages in all groups. All primary and secondary outcome measures will be evaluated during the 4 months of MMT treatment phase and for 6 months following the active treatment phase.",

In the initial patients we will explore the tolerability of escalating doses of levetiracetam as well as its potential role in reducing cocaine use, as monitored by self-report and verified by three-times weekly urine toxicology testing in methadone treated patients.The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of levetiracetam 3 grams/day in modifying cocaine-using behavior, reducing cocaine craving and attenuating cocaine's reinforcing effect among methadone-maintained patients",
    "detailed_description": "This 12-week open-label clinical trial will provide treatment for 15 cocaine-dependent opioid dependent patients. Participants, aged 18-65 years, will receive levetiracetam 3000 mg/day while concurrently receiving treatment with methadone. Baseline cocaine use will be determined during the first week of treatment participation.\n\nThe study design will have three overlapping phases that are summarized below: 1) A one week methadone fixed induction (week 1) and flexible stabilization phase (weeks 2-9); 2) an 8-week \"treatment\" phase (weeks 2-9), consisting of slow titration and stabilization on study medication; and 3) a four week \"taper, detoxification or transfer\" phase (weeks 9-12).\n\nDuring the first week of induction onto methadone, participants will be administered fixed increasing doses of methadone starting at 30 mg daily and increased to 60 mg daily by the end of the first week. This methadone dose will be adjusted for stabilization of opiate withdrawal symptoms using a flexible dosing from 40 mg up to 150 mg. This range has been found to be adequate for the vast majority of patients receiving methadone in our program and is designed to accommodate participants who may not be able to tolerate the higher maintenance doses or may still experience withdrawal symptoms, respectively. We may increase or decrease this amount on a case-by-case basis based on physician assessment of self-reported and observed symptoms.\n\nStarting on week 2 subjects will receive levetiracetam 500mg/day and this dose will be slowly titrated to a total of 3000mg/day or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects will remain on their full dosage through week 8.\n\nAt the end of week 8, participants will undergo detoxification from methadone over a 4-week period (weeks 8-12) and discontinuation from levetiracetam over a concurrent 2-week period. All participants will receive weekly 1-hour of individual psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Treatment) with experienced clinicians specifically trained to deliver the therapy and who will receive ongoing supervision. The primary outcomes will be reported medication side effects (medication tolerability), and reduction in cocaine use, as assessed by self-report and thrice-weekly urinalyses. Secondary outcomes will include weeks in treatment (retention), and change in measures of: cocaine craving, anxiety symptoms and opiate withdrawal symptoms. This study will occur at the Outpatient Treatment Research Program in Building 36 at the VA CT Healthcare System.",

Recent work suggests craving can influence how people make decisions and assign value to choice options available to them, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these interactions between craving and valuation remain unknown. To address this, this study uses cognitive decision-making tasks that measure how much individuals will pay (from a study endowment) to have everyday consumer items or snack foods when they crave something specific (opioids or a specific snack, respectively). First, the study will identify the neural mechanisms for how drug craving (craving for opioids) interacts with valuation for consumer items that have associations with drug use or not in people receiving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). This will be evaluated in the activity patterns and interactions among brain regions involved in craving and value assignment during decision-making. Then, the study will examine for parallel mechanisms for how food craving (craving for a specific snack) interacts with valuation for snack food items that have similar features to the craved snack or not in people receiving treatment for OUD and non-psychiatric community control participants.",

Thus, buccal naloxone may be particularly suitable for administration by family members who are providing interim overdose management care while awaiting the arrival of an ambulance.\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine the bioavailability and dose proportionality of buccal naloxone compared with the licensed injection standards (intravenous, intramuscular).\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that buccal naloxone is not inferior to the injection reference in absorption kinetics, i.e. time elapsed till peak concentration (Tmax\u037e primary outcome), peak plasma concentration (Cmax), overall absorption (AUC), bioavailability (F%) and, duration of action (mean terminal half-life\u037e T1/2).\n\nThe investigators propose a pharmacokinetic pilot investigation with within-subjects (crossover) design, comparing two doses (0.8 mg\u037e 1.6 mg) of buccal naloxone hydrochloride solution to the licensed intramuscular (IM\u037e 0.8 mg) and intravenous (IV\u037e 0.8 mg) routes of injection. The investigators will invite four healthy (i.e., non-opioid using) male volunteers (n=4, not powered), each of whom will attend four experimental sessions at counterbalanced sequence. Each volunteer will receive naloxone hydrochloride doses of 0.8 mg IM, 0.8 mg IV, 0.8 mg buccal, and 1.6 mg buccal, with only one dose administered per session.\n\nBlood concentrations will be measured at selected times during each session to establish speed of naloxone absorption, time to peak concentration, estimated half-life, and overall bioavailability. This dose-ranging pilot will inform future work by providing preliminary data on buccal naloxone absorption into the bloodstream and by establishing feasibility of the buccal route for naloxone delivery.",

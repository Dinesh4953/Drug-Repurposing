      "abstract": "The thiophene ethyl thiourea (TET) compound N'-[2-(2-thiophene)ethyl]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (HI-443) is a potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The pharmacokinetics of 17 different novel oral formulations of HI-443 were compared in an attempt to identify the most suitable dosage form for clinical use in HIV-infected persons. Plasma concentrations of HI-443 were monitored in mice after administration of the drug using these 17 different formulations at three time points. Two-way ANOVA showed highly significant formulation (p < 0.0001), time (p < 0.0001) and formulation*time interaction effects (p = 0.0003). Planned linear contrasts were performed to identify which formulations showed the highest bioavailability at 10, 30, 60 min and at all time points relative to DMSO alone. A significant positive regression was observed comparing bioavailibility of HI-443 at 10 min and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values of the formulations (R2 = 26%, p < 0.0001). The results showed that formulations that were hydrophilic, containing PEG400 and propylene glycol, gave the highest overall drug concentrations over the 60-min time period. The lead oral formulation of HI-443 exhibited a very favorable toxicity profile in BALB/c mice."

Craving for alcohol and compulsive drinking behavior are the main symptom of AUD. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and prefrontal-ventral striatum pathway. Studies have shown that abnormal phase synchronization and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) induced the impairment of cognition, and High-Intensity transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (HI-tACS) could improve executive-control function thus by adjusting the abnormal synchronization. However, it has not been verified among AUD patients. The investigators assume that tACS could improve AUD patients' executive-control function by adjusting the synchronization patterns and enhancing the functional connectivity of the prefrontal-ventral striatum pathway. This study intends to test the effect of HI-tACS treatment. Three-month follow-up assessment will be conducted to test the changing of the craving and alcohol use behavior. This study will provide a practical and theoretical basis for developing a novel treatment for AUD.",

      "brief_summary": "Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is a rare disorder of pancreatic beta cell insulin secretion that causes persistent and severe hypoglycemia starting at birth. Hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is the second most common type of congenital HI and is caused by activating mutations in glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Patients with HI/HA exhibit fasting hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, protein-induced hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, seizures, and intellectual disability independent of hypoglycemia. These effects result from abnormal GDH activity in the beta cells, liver and kidney cells, neurons, and astrocytes. The only available treatment for HI/HA syndrome is diazoxide, which acts on the beta cells to decrease insulin secretion but has no effect on GDH activity itself or on other cell types. Thus, there remains a significant unmet need for improved therapies for this disorder. Pre-clinical data show that vitamin E inhibits GDH activity in human cell lines and improves fasting hypoglycemia in a GDH HI mouse model. Pilot study data show that vitamin E supplementation with a moderate dose is well-tolerated in children and adults with HI/HA syndrome, while continuing diazoxide treatment. However, most subjects continued to exhibit protein-induced hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. We hypothesize that a higher vitamin E dose will inhibit GDH over-activity in subjects with HI/HA syndrome, resulting in improved hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, reduced blood ammonia concentration, and decreased seizure activity.",
      "detailed_description": "The primary objective of this study is to determine an effective dose of vitamin E to reduce protein-induced hyperinsulinemia in subjects with HI/HA syndrome. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of vitamin E on plasma C-peptide concentrations, serum alpha-tocopherol concentrations, blood ammonia concentrations, hypoglycemic events, and seizure frequency. The effect of vitamin E on brain glutamate levels and electroencephalogram findings will be explored.\n\nThis single-group open-label dose-finding clinical study will use a before-and-after design to compare clinical and laboratory data before and after 2-3 weeks of escalating doses of oral vitamin E treatment in subjects with HI/HA syndrome.\n\nThis single-site outpatient study will recruit up to 5 adult participants (18 years of age or older) with HI/HA syndrome.\n\nEach study visit will consist of blood tests, an IV leucine acute insulin response (AIR) test, home glucose meter and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) review, and a symptom questionnaire. The baseline and final visits will also include electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) analysis. After baseline assessments, including a 2 week run-in period of CGM use, subjects will take twice daily oral vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) at home. After steady-state of that dose of vitamin E has been achieved (i.e. at least 2 weeks on the dose of vitamin E), subjects will return for the next study visit. If there is no dose-limiting toxicity, then the twice daily vitamin E dose will be increased, and the subjects will return for a subsequent study visit after at least 2 weeks. If there is no dose-limiting toxicity at this visit, then the twice daily vitamin E dose will be increased again, and the subjects will return for a final study visit after at least 2 weeks. If toxicity is identified at any point, vitamin E will be discontinued and final study visit procedures will be performed.",

This study attempt to see the effect of radiotherapy in preventing re-occurrence and its side effects in advanced thyroid cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "Surgery, when possible offers the best chance of cure for cancer of the thyroid gland. Surgery for thyroid cancer involves removal of the thyroid gland along with removal of the lymph nodes which drain the gland. After surgery most patients will receive radio-iodine treatment to diagnose and treat any spread of the cancer in the body. Most thyroid cancers will have good outcomes with the above mentioned treatment. However, in advanced thyroid cancer there is a higher chance of recurrence even with surgery and radio iodine. Surgery for recurrence of these cancers is very morbid This may entail surgeries which may also involve removing portions of the voice box and food pipe. You may therefore develop and discomfort or inability to eat or speak.\n\nRadiation therapy can be given to the neck along with radio-iodine therapy to decrease these re occurrences of the cancer. A number of studies have shown a benefit with the use of radiation therapy in advanced cases of thyroid cancer. However, the side effects of radiation, if any, have not been well documented. This study is being done to assess the impact of radiation on the outcome of cancer and the exact side effects of radiation therapy. If the side effects are not too many, then radiation therapy can be used to decrease the chances of recurrence in the neck after thyroid.\n\nIn this study, patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer will be assessed for high risk features on the histopathology report and the intra operative findings. Those with advanced thyroid cancer as per the eligibility criteria will be counselled and consented for the study. Those patients willing to participate in the study will be randomised to either receive only surgery and radio-iodine or surgery, radio-iodine and external beam radiation.",

      "detailed_description": "Seventy six (76) subjects (152 eyes) were enrolled and dispensed in the multisite, randomized, double masked clinical study to provide data that support the presumption of equivalence of the HDS HI 1.54\u2122 investigational lenses to a historical control contact lens. Sixty four (64) subjects (84.2%) completed the study and 12 subjects (15.8%) were discontinued. The population demographics were similar to previous contact lens studies.\n\nOf the ten Test subjects who discontinued, Difficulty Cleaning Lenses (3 subjects) and Poor Comfort (2 subjects), Poor Vision (1 subject) and Poor Vision and Poor Comfort (2 subjects) accounted for 80% of the discontinuations. Two Control subjects discontinued, one for Loss of Interest and one for Poor Comfort There were no adverse events reported during the study. The only study related complications were slit lamp findings of grade 3 for injection. Each of these resolved without complication.\n\nSlit lamp findings were reported at frequencies within expected values and the positive slit lamp observations were primarily grade 1 (trace). Staining and injection were reported most frequently. Subject reports of no symptoms were lowest at the 1 week visit for both the Completed Test and Control eyes and then increased over the remainder of the study. Discomfort was reported most frequently (13.7% of Completed Test eye visits and 12.3% of Completed Control Eye visits). .\n\nLens comfort was rated as an average of 4.04 (very good) for the Completed Test eyes and 4.07 (very good) for the Completed Control eyes. This compared to a baseline value of 3.96 for the Test eyes and 4.23 for the Control eyes with the pre-study habitual correction.\n\nKeratometry changes were within 1.00 diopter for 93.1% of the Completed Test eyes and 96.4% of the Completed Control eyes. Manifest refraction changes were within 1.00 diopter for 97.9% of the Completed Test eyes and 98.2% of the Completed Control eyes.\n\nOne eye of the 63 Completed Test eyes targeted for full distance vision was reported to show a decrease in contact lens visual acuity from the baseline best corrected visual acuity of greater than 0.20 logMAR. The reason for the loss was a reported baseline measurement error. One eye of the 48 Completed Control eyes targeted for full distance vision was reported to show a decrease in contact lens visual acuity from the baseline best corrected visual acuity of greater than 0.20 logMAR. The reason cited for the decrease was lenses being switched eye for eye.\n\nAverage lens wearing time was stable at over 13 hours per day for the Completed Test and Control subjects and showed a decrease over time for the discontinued eyes.\n\nForty nine (49) lens replacements were made for 40 of the 152 eyes dispensed in the study. The replacements were predominantly for deposits (8) or parameter and power change (21) which together account for 59% of the lens replacements. Discomfort was cited for 18.4% (5 test and 4 control lenses) of the lens replacements. Five lenses (10%) were replaced due to loss.\n\nThe results of the clinical evaluation of the Paragon HDS HI 1.54\u2122 contact lenses provide evidence of substantial equivalence to the historical control, Paragon Fluroperm\u00ae 30 contact lenses.",

      "detailed_description": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder characterized by a high suicide rate and significant disability. Cognitive impairment is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, with approximately 98% of patients experiencing a decline in cognitive function compared to pre-illness levels. Research has found that individuals with schizophrenia show significant impairments in seven domains, including reaction time, attention, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, logical reasoning, and social cognition.\n\nPharmacological treatment remains the primary approach for managing schizophrenia. However, cognitive impairment in individuals with schizophrenia often does not respond well to medication. Additionally, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may have potential cognitive side effects. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a form of noninvasive brain stimulation, has been found in several studies to improve cognition. However, its effectiveness is not yet clear.\n\nConventional tACS utilizes weak currents below 4mA, which can only directly stimulate certain cortical areas and indirectly stimulate deep brain structures. Moreover, the targeting of specific brain regions can be complex, and users may experience a sensation of heat on the skin where the electrodes come into contact.High-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (Hi-tACS) employs electrical currents greater than 10mA, typically ranging from 10-15mA. Unlike conventional tACS, Hi-tACS can apply stimulation to the entire brain, potentially enhancing its therapeutic effects. Moreover, Hi-tACS does not require precise targeting and is generally well-tolerated without any discomfort during the stimulation. It is considered a promising and potentially safe treatment modality for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.",

The investigators hypothesize that the perceived sounds will elicit increased pupil dilation compared to the non-perceived sounds and that the hearing threshold as measured with pure tone audiometry will correlate to the results in pupillometry test. The investigators hypothesize that the effect will be visible in all testing groups albeit the relative increase of pupil size with age. Hypothesis confirmed, the investigators will develop a standardised procedure for the auditory signal detection using pupillometry. Such a procedure could represent an important bridge between automatic and behavioral hearing tests. With a more precise test of auditory threshold of young children, post-operative monitoring and fitting of cochlear implants or hearing aids, and rehabilitation procedures, could be considerably more targeted and consequentially more efficient.",

      "brief_summary": "Based on emerging experience and trials from countries affected early by the COVID-19 (COV19) pandemic, there is evidence that a subgroup of severely affected people develop a hyperinflammatory (HI) syndrome (COV-HI). Trials are in progress of cytokine inhibition and other immune modulation to treat COV-HI. This proposal aims to use a rapidly executed cohort study to characterise the clinical phenotypes of COV-HI in patients in the UK through an established and nimble network of clinicians and scientists with broad experience of identifying and treating HI. The aim is to confirm the COV-HI clinical phenotype and using routine data to try to infer the inflexion point where COV-HI emerges. This would enable refinement of the proposed treatment algorithm and translates to routine clinical practice to improve the outlook for COV-HI.",
      "detailed_description": "Early information from the UK ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre)- COVID-19 Study Case Mix Programme Database 27 March 2020 report that critical care unit admissions with COVID-19 totaled 775 patients of whom 79 patients have died, 86 patients were discharged alive from critical care and 609 patients were last reported as still being in critical care. It is imperative to reduce this high death rate. Emerging evidence from China, Italy and the US suggests that in a small subset of patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease there is a hyperinflammatory syndrome (COV-HI), which may be contributing to the high mortality and morbidity.\n\nTerminology regarding hyperinflammation is heterogenous. When caused by genetic abnormalities in children it is called primary or familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH). Secondary HLH (sHLH) is a hyperinflammatory process driven by infection, rheumatic disorders and malignancy (usually lymphoproliferative disorders). sHLH is termed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) when associated with rheumatic disease, macrophage activation-like syndrome (MALS) in sepsis, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) following immune effector cell therapies (haplo-identical allogeneic stem cell transplantation or CAR-T cell therapy). It is likely that such hyperinflammatory states lie on a spectrum and collectively the clinical phenomenon has been called cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) or hyperinflammation (HI).\n\nCurrent diagnostic criteria for HI are based on fHLH (HLH-2004 guidelines) and the H score (a weighted composite generating a probability). Recently published management algorithms in adults are based on consensus expert opinion and clinical experience, extrapolated from paediatric literature in fHLH.\n\nThe HLH Across-speciality Collaboration (HASC) is a 162-strong group of clinicians/scientists who specialize in the management of patients with hyperinflammation. HASC member include Rheumatologists, Haematologists, Intensivists, Infectious Disease specialists, Immunologists, Virologists, Nephrologists and Gatroenterologists from both adult and paediatric backgrounds. Members of HASC have led the set-up of multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTs) to raise awareness of and manage hyperinflammatory illness, completed national audits to demonstrate hyperinflammation is often missed and have set up HLH registries and bioresources (https://research.ncl.ac.uk/ukhr/).\n\nCOVID-19 hyperinflammation (COV-HI): rationale for treatment and summary of available evidence In COVID-19 respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. ARDS is a late pre-terminal event in these patients but there is a reported clinical phenotype of severe COVID-19 where hyperinflammation complicates the respiratory failure, termed here COVID-19 hyperinflammation or COV-HI.\n\nA cytokine profile resembling sHLH (a variant of HI) is associated with COVID-19 disease severity, characterised by increased interleukin (IL), -2, -6 -7, -8 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-ginducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1\\[i\\]. Predictors of fatality from two recent retrospective, multi-centre studies of confirmed COVID-19 cases included elevated ferritin, c reactive protein (CRP) and serum IL-6. In the first study of 150 confirmed cases, the mean ferritin was 1297.6 ng/ml in non-survivors (n=68) versus 614.0 ng/ml in survivors (n=82); p\\<0.001) 9. Subsequently in 193 confirmed cases, the mean ferritin was 1453 ng/ml in non-survivors (n=54) versus 503 ng/ml in survivors (n=137) (p\\<0.0001). Ferritin \\>300ng/ml (p=0.0038) and raised IL-6 (p=0.0080) were both associated with in-hospital death.\n\nData publicly available on MedRciv demonstrates that in a retrospective study of 100 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, disease activity correlated with parameters known to be elevated in HLH, including IL-6 (p\\<0.001) and ferroprotein (p\\<0.001). Publicly available data on Chinaciv of 21 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab (anti-IL6 blockade), demonstrated that all patients became afebrile within 24 hours of treatment. In this study following tocilizumab treatment there was a reduction of oxygen requirement (15/20 patients), resolution of CT lesions (19/21 patients), normalization of lymphocyte count (10/19 patients), reduction of CRP levels (16/19 patients) and hospital discharge (19/21 patients) with an average hospitalization duration of 13.5 days. There were no adverse events attributable to tocilizumab. Personal communication from the investigators in Italy and treating physicians within the UK, has confirmed clinical benefit using tocilizumab in a group phenotypically in the COV-HI group, without overt adverse event. Trials are opening internationally using tocilizumab in the COV-HI group.\n\nIL-1 is central to the hypercytokinaemia in HLH. Off-licence anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is recommended in treatment algorithms for HLH. There are active trials looking at the role of anakinra (see for example https://www.sobi.com/sites/default/files/pr/202003183346-1.pdf) and tocilizumab (see for example http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=494090) in the management of COV-HI patients and insertion of cytokine inhibitor arms into the adaptive platform REMAP CAP (https://www.remapcap.org). There is increasingly reported anecdotal experience of successful use of tocilizumab and anakinra in COV-HI and scientific rationale for plausibility.\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that high mortality may be due to virally-driven hyperinflammation in COVID-19 (COV-HI), that could be identified with routinely available clinical and laboratory data. Of particular note are C-reactive protein - CRP a surrogate for IL-6 - and ferritin, both tested in general medical assessment of unwell patients. Outcome could be improved if the COV-HI phenotype can be characterised; such phenotyping will inform trial design (in which HASC members are heavily involved) as well as identifying patients in hospitals overwhelmed by clinical cases who can be recruited to those trials. In particular, understanding the clinical course of those admitted to hospital (who by definition have severe COVID-19 and are at risk of COV-HI) and the inflexion point at which COV-HI emerges would enable targeted treatment. Such characterisation of phenotype is currently not available but HASC have mobilised the UK network to collect the data to inform this gap in the evidence.\n\nIdentifying people who, at the point of needing respiratory support, could potentially benefit from immune modulation may be possible by interrogating continuous clinical \\& laboratory data collected from hospital admission to the time of recovery/death.\n\nThis will be a retrospective cohort study. Due to the urgent nature of this research and the need to rapidly gather information about each patient's clinical experience and outcome during the COVID-19 pandemic it will not be possible to gain informed written consent.\n\nIt is proposed to:\n\n1. Collect demographic information on consecutive people admitted to selected sites across the UK (initially UCLH, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield) with COVID-19 starting with the institution's first case. Hospital admission is proxy for severe COVID 19. Map their clinical journey by collecting serial clinical and laboratory data from routine clinical investigations during the course of their illness at 24-hour intervals\n2. Retrospectively analyse data to try to identify patients who subsequently fit the COV-HI phenotype. Look in detail at these cases to understand whether there is an inflexion point early in their disease course such that a point for intervention with immune modulation could be have been made.\n\n   It will be important to differentiate between people deteriorating due to organ failure because of co-morbidity and poor reserve, compared to those with overwhelming inflammatory response fitting with the proposed hypothesis. For the former group, the risk associated with immune modulation is likely to outweigh the benefit.\n3. Use data collection to define criteria that could be used as threshold for treatment\n\nDe-identified data will be accessed by all members of the team who have contributed their patients to the study and to collaborators within the UK for statistical analysis. Patient age will be retained in the de-identified data as this is an essential clinical variable but NHS number, DOB, ICNARC number and date of admission will not be visible to members of the team who are not the normal care team of a given patient. The risk of identification of a patient from their age and diagnosis alone is very low.\n\nEveryone with access to person-identifiable information will hold an NHS contract or honorary contract and have received necessary training regarding GDPR and Good Clinical Practice, and will be fully aware of their responsibilities to patient confidentiallity.\n\nUnderstand and comply with the law. This has been set up as a research study using project specific data stored on the REDCap platform at Newcastle University. The data will be held on secure servers with dual password protection (login and SMS OTP) at Newcastle University.",

Most estimates are in the order of 35-45%.(McHardy 1999, Higgins 2002) There is evidence that many patients do not report sore throat and/or vocal changes unless directly asked because surgical pain is more prominent and many patients may be unaware that intubation completed as part of the general anesthetic. (Harding 1987)\n\nThe Parker FlexTip\u00ae endotracheal tube (ETT) is formulated with a softer plastic at the distal tip as well as a laterally curved profile to reduce trauma during ETT advancement. (Makino 2003) This ETT has been shown to be faster during fibreoptic intubation, but complication of sore throat was not examined. (Kristensen 2003)\n\nOur previous study (Jones 2007) demonstrated that modification of anesthetic techniques could reduce the incidence of post-operative sore throat in patients undergoing naso-tracheal intubation. We will now study the Parker Flex-Tip ETT to see if its use can also reduce the incidence of sore throat in patients undergoing oro-tracheal intubation.",

The control group will be treated with OptiBond Universal, a conventional adhesive providing mechanical bonding without bioactive properties.\n\nClinical outcomes will be evaluated using the FDI World Dental Federation criteria, focusing on functional properties such as fracture resistance, marginal adaptation, and retention. Radiographic assessments will quantify dentin remineralization using digital grayscale analysis. Hypersensitivity will be recorded using a patient-reported Likert scale at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\nThe primary outcome is the functional integrity of the restorative material, assessed at 24 months.

It reaches the trunk and limbs, with an incidence of 4-35%, and gradually disappears after the end of treatment.\n\nPreventive targeted educational action is essential before initiation of cancer treatment. Once the xerosis is installed, the management is based on the use of emollients to contribute to the hydric correction of the skin. In the case of inflammation or associated infection, the administration of topical corticosteroids and / or local or oral antibiotic therapy is prescribed.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the cosmetic product (balm) on the improvement of xerosis induced by systemic anticancer treatments, in participants receiving targeted educational action compared to a control group.\n\nClinical, biological and biometrological assessments will be performed to characterized the effects in both induced xerosis and associated signs and symptoms.\n\nEach group will include 40 participants.",

The objective is to provide data on this product in this symptomatology.\n\nXerosis and the associated dermatological signs / symptoms will be assessed individually as well as through overall scores, as measured by both the investigator and the patient as clinical expression is often poorly correlated with psychic and functional impact. Quality of life, cosmetic acceptability and targeted educational action and tolerance will also be assessed.\n\nThe improvement of the quality of life of the patients, the reduction of the undesirable effects induced could thus guarantee the observance of the patients vis-\u00e0-vis the anticancer treatments.\n\nThe study area is the whole body. A target area will be chosen and will be located on one of the upper limbs (outside the hands) or on the trunk (outside a hairy area). The target area is defined as the xerosis area representative of the the most severe xerotic state, according to the investigator's opinion.\n\nThe dermatologist who will evaluate the participant should be, as far as possible, the same throughout the study.\n\nA second period will be carried out by the participants of the control group who will enter in the targeted educational action phase of in their turn.\n\nThe study includes 2 visits for the informed group and 3 visits for the control group:\n\n* V1 (J1) - Inclusion (common to both groups)\n* V2 (J21 \u00b1 2J or J28 \u00b1 2J) - End of study (informed group) - Intermediate (control group)\n* V3 (J42 \u00b1 2J or J56 \u00b1 2J) - End of study (control group) The dates of the visits 2 and 3 will be adapted to the frequency of the visits of administration of the anticancer treatment.\n\nThe maximum duration of participation for a participant may be 23 days or 44 days or it may be 30 days or 58 days from the inclusion visit to the end-of-study visit, depending on the group and depending the timeframe between cancer treatment visits.\n\nAll subjects in the control group will enter onto the informed group after three weeks or one month (depending on the timeframe between cancer treatment visits), regardless of their condition (presence or absence of on-going xerosis).",

The principal investigators are professors Shen Feng and Zhang Xiaofeng from The Third Affiliated Hospital of Navy Military Medical University (Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital).\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP in the treatment of refractory/recurrent advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumors.\n2. To assess the efficacy of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP in the treatment of refractory/recurrent advanced HCC and other solid tumors, focusing on progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the efficacy of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP in the treatment of refractory/recurrent advanced HCC and other solid tumors at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, assessing disease control rate (DCR: CR+PR+SD), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).\n2. To observe and assess the quality of life (QOL score) of patients receiving super Hi-TCR-T cell therapy targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP for refractory/recurrent advanced HCC and other solid tumors.\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the relationship between the in vivo expansion and persistence of super Hi-TCR-T cells targeting Nectin4/NKG2DL/TROP2/B7H3/GPC3/FAP and disease progression.\n2. To explore potential predictive biomarkers. Thirty patients are planned to be recruited for this study. The subjects were advanced HCC patients who had failed second-line therapy or could not tolerate therapy. The expression levels of Nectin4, NKG2DL, TROP2, B7H3, GPC3 and FAP were detected by immunohistochemistry in the pathologic tissues of the primary and metastatic sites. Meanwhile, 20ml peripheral blood was extracted to evaluate the quality of T cells (in vitro proliferation activity and lentiviral transduction efficiency). Patients with positive expression rates of at least 2 targets (excluding FAP) \\>10% and qualified T cell quality could be considered for inclusion.\n\nPeripheral blood lymphocytes were collected and Hi-TCR-T cells targeting three targets (including FAP) were prepared. After pretreatment with fludarabine + cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (FC regimen), the prepared Hi-TCR-T cells were transfused back, in which the dose of Hi-TCR-T cells at each target was 3.0x106 cells/kg body weight (the dose was the extended therapeutic dose obtained in the previous clinical trial), and the drug was administered by peripheral intravenous infusion. To improve efficacy, Hi-TCR-T cell retransfusion can be prepared by increasing the cell dose of the target or changing the combination of the target as the disease progresses and evaluated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\n\nSafety and efficacy evaluation and exploratory studies were conducted after reinfusion of Hi-TCR-T cells from screening multiple targets:\n\n1. Safety assessment: at baseline, 4, 7, 10, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 6, 9 and 12 months after cell therapy;\n2. Effectiveness evaluation: at baseline, 4, 12, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 months after cell therapy. Safety assessment: At baseline, 4, 7, 10, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 6, 9, and 12 months after cell therapy;\n3. Exploratory study: 20ml peripheral blood was collected from patients at baseline, 7 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months after cell therapy, to explore the relationship between the proliferation and survival time of Hi-TCR-T cells in vivo and the changes of disease and peripheral blood cytokines.\n\nThe start time of the study was defined as the date the first patient was enrolled; The end time of the study was defined as 12 months after the end of medication for the final patient, or all patients died, or all patients had lost follow-up or withdrawn consent (whichever occurred first). The planned recruitment period is 12-18 months.",

This increase is a result of activation of systemic inflammatory cascade, part of COVID-19 pathophysiologic pathway. This can escalate to state known as COVID-19 associated hyperinflamation (COV-HI). In addition, current diagnostic tools for diagnosing HAP/VAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia) are often limited in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

The COV-HI phenotype (COV-HI: CRP \\> 150 mg/L, or doubling within 24 h from greater than 50 mg/L, or ferritin concentration \\> 1500 ug/L) is associated with significantly worse course of illness and higher mortality rates. These inflammatory markers may be used preferentially as prognostication tools, not bacterial superinfection markers. The intention of this project is to investigate the role of currently used inflammatory biomarkers. Or eventually, to discover new parameters associated with superinfection proven by BAL.",

If superiority is shown, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken.\n\nSecondary hypotheses to be tested relate to patient-reported knee pain and function, health-related quality of life, functional ambulation, and knee joint mobility.\n\nSuperiority in these outcomes will be evident at six months after surgery.",

We conducted a pilot study assessing the open label use of re-breathing CO2 (using Hi-OxSR) twice a day for 14 days, for the treatment of post-COVID cognitive dysfunction. Significant improvements were found in multiple cognitive assessments using TestMyBrain cognitive tests and brain fog (MSNQ) and fatigue scores. This phase 2 clinical trial seeks to build on current findings to determine the optimal effective dose of treatment (i.e. length of use, oxygen concentration, without or without CO2 rebreathing) and the safety of using Hi-OxSR in this patient population.",

The aging process is often associated with natural health debilitation, impairment of cognitive abilities, depression, loneliness and decreased daily life activity. Therefore, by increasing the number of older people also increase the needs and demands of health systems to serve this population. Government programs and projects that promote health and quality of life for this group must be developed and researched, so that the population aging happens in a satisfactory way and with physical and mental health. Several researches have been done on interventions that prevent the symptoms of memory impairment in elderly and on delaying symptoms of Mild Cognitive Impairment. Studies indicate that Mindfulness-Based Interventions (IBMs) are effective in the treatment of depression, anxiety, stress, chronic pain and in promoting well-being to young people and adults, yet the field of study of these interventions with the elderly is still a field to be explored and deepened. This project will focus on the discussion about the effectiveness of the Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion Program (MBHP) in the cognitive functions and quality of life of the elderly, based on quantitative and qualitative analysis. It will be used neuropsychological test and scales to assess the level of consciousness in the present moment, acceptance, self-compassion, quality of life and daily life activity, as well as a qualitative analysis through a structured script using the word evocation method and interviews through focus group.",

      "detailed_description": "Extensive literature documents that endothelial dysfunction is associated with almost every condition predisposing to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Hence, endothelial dysfunction is significantly associated with the burden of cardiovascular risk and can be considered a barometer of the total risk burden. Importantly, microvascular dysfunction has been shown to increase risk of future cardiovascular events.\n\nThis study aims to clarify if ticagrelor, but not prasugrel or clopidogrel is associated to an improved reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and circulating levels of specific biomarkers of endothelial function, at treatment steady state. Ticagrelor has previously been demonstrated to increase adenosine levels by inhibiting adenosine reuptake in red blood cells, by inhibiting the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT)-1. Furthermore, ticagrelor can induce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from human red blood cells. Interestingly, ticagrelor, but not clopidogrel or prasugrel have been recently shown to be associated to an improved endothelial function as evaluated with peripheral arterial tonometry after forearm ischemia.\n\nPost-ACS patients (who experienced an acute coronary syndrome and thereby started therapy with an oral P2Y12 inhibitor at least 30 days before) will be consecutively screened for possible inclusion. Patients will then be randomised to receive in a sequential manner the three oral P2Y12 blockers (i.e.) ticagrelor, prasugrel or clopidogrel for at least 30 days each, according to a balanced cross-over study design including the sequences below:\n\nSeq\\\\ Per P.I P.II P.III S.I T P C S.II T C P S.III P T C S.IV P C T S.V C T P S.VI C P T During the three months study period the therapy with the P2Y12 inhibitor will be switched as for randomization sequence scheme.\n\nWhen started, each drug will be given with the corresponding loading dose of 600 mg for clopidogrel and then continued at 75 mg/day, 180 mg for ticagrelor and then continued at 90 mg b.i.d. and 60 mg for prasugrel and then continued at 10 mg/day (5 mg/day for patients \u226575 years or weighing \u2264 60 kg).\n\nThe main measurements, including reactive hypermedia index, PRU, aspirin reaction units, and circulating markers of endothelial function will be performed at baseline, after P2Y12-inhibitor loading dose, before and after P2Y12-inhibitor maintenance dose.\n\nDuring the visit, blood pressure will be measured in the contralateral arm before examination. The EndoPAT probes will be placed on the index fingers. If the index finger will be missing or deformed, another finger will be used, using the same finger on both hands. Baseline registration will be conducted for 5 min. The test arm will be then occluded for 5 min, using a standard blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm. Subsequently, the cuff was deflated and the registration continued for 5 more minutes. After EndoPAT, blood will be drawn to collect serum and plasma for biomarkers assessment \\[Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), adenosine plasma concentration, von willebrand factor antigen, endothelin-1, C-reactive protein, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), prothrombin fragment 1+2, fibrinopeptide A, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT)\\]. To assess the relationship between residual platelet reactivity or percent inhibition and effect of P2Y12 oral blocker on endothelial function, platelet function testing will be also carried out acutely and at treatment steady state by means of the Verifynow system using both P2Y12 and aspirin assays.\n\nBased on previous findings, we set mean RHI at 1.8 with a within subjects SD of 0.31. Hence, 36 patients completing all sequences (i.e. 6 pt/sequence) will provide 90% power to detect a 10% RHI relative change in the ticagrelor group with a two-sided alpha level at 5%. To account for drop outs as well as incomplete data assessment at all time points, a final sample size of 50 patients will be recruited.\n\nPatients will be provided with a regular drug prescription (standard of care medication). At each follow-up the investigator will collect information about adherence to the study drug and register the charge number of the prescribed P2Y12.\n\nAllocation of study treatment will be performed via a web-based interactive randomization system, based on a computer-generated random sequence with a random block size stratified according to the type of P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor vs prasugrel vs clopidogrel) as well as for the presence of diabetes mellitus.\n\nAdverse events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during the study, whether or not considered related to study. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject or observed by the investigator or his staff will be recorded. Serious adverse events in this study are considered to be extremely rare.",

We have demonstrated malfunction of transcriptional pathways in the heat stressed HI phenotype and an altered gene expression profile compared to Heat Tolerant (HT) individuals. Such differences are evident even under normothermic basal/comfort conditions. Heat and exercise challenges during the heat tolerance test (HTT) further emphasize the differences between the groups, particularly during recovery at comfort temperatures. Our results indicate that it may be possible to identify markers of heat intolerance. To achieve this goal, we plan to design a cellular (lymphocyte) HTT experimental model and detect gene expression profiles using customized DNA microarrays and bioinformatic tools (the genes selected will be based on our previous DNA microarray studies). Lymphocyte samples collected from HT and HI individuals under resting/comfort conditions will be examined. Treatments and analyses are designed to reveal HI-associated gene-expression profiles (constitutive or inducible), and thereby find lymphocyte markers to identify individuals predisposed to heat injury. The identification of such subjects could prevent unnecessary loss of life. Notably, the rapidly changing climate in our era increases the number of occupation/age groups in which manifestations of HI will appear.",

      "detailed_description": "Women are diagnosed with Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) if they experience chronic loss of desire for sex together with significant distress or interpersonal difficulties due to this lack of desire. HSDD can have a serious effect on emotional well-being and interpersonal relationships.\n\nThere are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for HSDD. Off-label treatments include testosterone, which is not always effective and can be accompanied by side effects such as excess hair growth, acne, and decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.\n\nResearch in laboratory animals and clinical observations in humans suggest that re-balancing chemical messengers in the brain may stimulate sexual desire. S1 Biopharma's Lorexys\u00ae is a novel use fixed-dose combination (FDC) in an oral pill. Lorexys\u00ae combines two agents intended to restore balance to the brain's centers that control sexual function. Such effects are hoped to help women with HSDD.\n\nThe compound is Phase 2-ready without prior trials (Phase I safety studies) because the two agents have often been used together; individually, they are FDA-approved for treating other disorders (depression, for example), and in a large US survey, the two were taken together in about 23% of patients who were prescribed one of the two agents.\n\nThis research study requires subjects to take three different study medications for four weeks each, with at least a one-week \"wash-out\" period after each, and to report on rating scales how they feel. The medication is open-label (the subjects can see which medication they are receiving). That should not interfere with the evaluations or cause a big \"placebo effect\" because only a low proportion of women with HSDD have responded to a placebo in prior research studies of other compounds when using the same measures of efficacy.\n\nParticipation lasts 16 weeks, with 8 clinic visits. A weekly, but no daily, self-rating is required between visits.",

Methods: Forty pseudophakic patients (29\u2640, 11\u2642; age 60-80 years) with ERM underwent 27G pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and were randomly divided into two groups: Group I (20 eyes, stand-ard microscope \\[Hi-R 900\\], endo-illumination 3.2 Lm) and Group II (20 eyes, 3D heads-up NGE-NUITY system, endo-illumination 0.5 Lm). Preoperative and 6-month postoperative evaluations included slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure (IOP, Pascal tonometer), Distance Best Correct-ed Visual Acuity (DBCVA, logMAR), Central Subfield Thickness (CST), Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness (RNFL, OCT), Pattern ERG (PERG), multifocal ERG (mfERG), flash ERG (ERG, IS-CEV standards), and retinal sensitivity (HFA macula test). Surgery time, xenon light exposure, ERM/ILM peeling time, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), metamorphopsia incidence, and intra-/postoperative adverse events were analyzed. Results were statistically evaluated (p \\< 0.05).",

      "brief_summary": "This was a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability after administration of multiple doses of remibrutinib in participants with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (HI) compared to pooled matched healthy control participants with normal hepatic function.",
      "detailed_description": "This study was conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 was comprised of participants with mild (Child Pugh A; Group 1) and moderate (Child-Pugh B; Group 2) HI and matched healthy control participants with normal hepatic function (Group 4). Groups 1 and 2 were enrolled in parallel. Part 2 was comprised of participants with severe HI (Child-Pugh C; Group 3) and matched healthy control participants with normal hepatic function (Group 4). Matched healthy control participants (Group 4) were enrolled in parallel to Parts 1 and 2.\n\nUp to 48 male and female participants, aged 18 to 70 years inclusive, were planned to be enrolled, with 8 participants enrolled in each of the mild (Child-Pugh A; Group 1 in Part 1), moderate (Child Pugh B; Group 2 in Part 1), and severe (Child-Pugh C; Group 3 in Part 2) HI groups, and up to 24 participants planned to be enrolled in the matched healthy control group (Group 4 from Parts 1 and 2). Additional participant(s) may have been enrolled if a participant discontinued from the study before completion of the PK assessment to ensure that at least 6 participants in each group completed the scheduled PK assessments. Due to difficulties in enrolling severe HI participants, only 7 severe HI participants were enrolled in this study.\n\nEach study part was comprised of a screening period of up to 28 days (Day -29 to Day -2), a Baseline evaluation on Day -1, and a treatment period including up to 8 days of safety and PK data collection. Participants who met the eligibility criteria at Screening were admitted for Baseline evaluations on Day 1. Baseline safety assessments were performed prior to first dosing of study treatment. Participants were domiciled from Day -1 through Day 8.\n\nAll participants received 25 mg remibrutinib b.i.d. orally under fasting conditions on Days 1 and 2, and a morning oral dose of 25 mg remibrutinib on Day 3. PK samples were collected predose on Day 3 and until 72 hours post Day 3 dosing. Throughout the study, safety assessments included physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation), and AE/serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring.\n\nThe investigator and Novartis conducted a joint interim review of safety and PK data from Part 1 before proceeding to Part 2. Data from at least 4 participants with mild HI (Group 1), 4 participants with moderate HI (Group 2), and their matched healthy control participants (Group 4), who completed PK study assessments up to Day 6 in Part 1, were evaluated.\n\nPart 2 only began after administration of remibrutinib in the 4 evaluable participants from each of the mild and moderate HI groups (Groups 1 and 2) and their matched healthy control participants (Group 4) in Part 1 was deemed safe and tolerable based on the interim review by the investigator and Novartis. Depending on the outcome of the interim review, administration of a lower dose of remibrutinib in severe HI participants (Group 3) and their matched healthy control participants was to be considered. However, upon review of the interim data, the decision was made to not change the dose for severe HI participants.\n\nAs per the current study protocol, study drug strengths available for this trial were 25 mg and 10 mg. Therefore, the lowest dose that could have been used in Part 2 was 10 mg b.i.d. At the time of the interim data review, a decision was to be made as to whether or not to reduce the Part 2 dose, based on observed PK exposures and safety assessments in Part 1 and predicted exposures in severe HI participants in Part 2. In this particular case, Part 2 was to be initiated after the submission and approval of a Substantial Amendment from the respective Health Authorities (HA) and Ethics Committee (EC) were obtained. A decision was made to proceed with Part 2 using the same 25 mg dose as in Part 1.\n\nStudy Completion evaluations occurred on Day 8, followed by a post-study safety follow-up contact (e.g., follow-up telephone call, e-mail) approximately 30 days after last administration of study treatment. The information collected during the follow-up contact was kept as source documentation. The study was considered completed once all the participants finished the required assessments.\n\nThe total study duration for each participant was expected to be up to approximately 62 days, including the Screening period and the follow-up contact.",

      "detailed_description": "Men who have sex with men are the risk population most heavily impacted by HIV in the United States by any measure; in 2009, at least 61% of new HIV infections were estimated to have occurred in MSM. MSM are experiencing an increase in HIV transmission that has been occurring since at least 1990, and accelerated in multiple North American and European countries from 2000-2005. The expansion of the HIV epidemic has been proposed to be attributable, in part, to the extent to which the internet has facilitated sexual connectivity among MSM.\n\nResearchers have attempted to reach MSM for HIV prevention research and intervention on the internet. In the past 10 years, there has been a proliferation of internet surveys and HIV research studies among men who have sex with men that utilize the internet for data collection and, in some cases, the delivery of HIV prevention content. The development of internet-based interventions has been recently identified as especially promising because of its potential for scalability. However, there are also important limitations to internet-based data collections and prevention studies. The most important of these relate to representativeness and opportunities to introduce bias to data collections and differences in access to and use of internet among different subgroups of MSM. Equally important, although less discussed, are the unique ethical and human research protections challenges posed by online sexual health prevention studies.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a series of experiments that will result in improved knowledge of how to conduct internet-based HIV prevention research with MSM in ways that improve the protection of human subjects and decrease biases in data collections. The design will consist of preparatory online qualitative research with up to 100 MSM, followed by two cross-sectional randomized controlled trials of MSM recruited online; a total of 2440 MSM will be enrolled in the two randomized quantitative studies (1,440 in Study 1 to determine optimal methods to provide informed consent, online, and 1000 in Study 2 to determine how to best improve retention in online surveys). About 2440 men will be enrolled in the study in total. This summary describes Study 1; a separate submission will be completed for Study 2.",

      "detailed_description": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder characterized by a high suicide rate and significant disability. Cognitive impairment is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, with approximately 98% of patients experiencing a decline in cognitive function compared to pre-illness levels. Research has found that individuals with schizophrenia show significant impairments in seven domains, including reaction time, attention, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, logical reasoning, and social cognition.\n\nPharmacological treatment remains the primary approach for managing schizophrenia. However, cognitive impairment in individuals with schizophrenia often does not respond well to medication. Additionally, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may have potential cognitive side effects. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a form of noninvasive brain stimulation, has been found in several studies to improve cognition. However, its effectiveness is not yet clear.\n\nConventional tACS utilizes weak currents below 4mA, which can only directly stimulate certain cortical areas and indirectly stimulate deep brain structures. Moreover, the targeting of specific brain regions can be complex, and users may experience a sensation of heat on the skin where the electrodes come into contact.High-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (Hi-tACS) employs electrical currents greater than 10mA, typically ranging from 10-15mA. Unlike conventional tACS, Hi-tACS can apply stimulation to the entire brain, potentially enhancing its therapeutic effects. Moreover, Hi-tACS does not require precise targeting and is generally well-tolerated without any discomfort during the stimulation. It is considered a promising and potentially safe treatment modality for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.",

Almost 50% of people screened for TJA are referred for further rehabilitation rather than TJA. However, access to community-based rehabilitation is limited for those living in rural settings. Recent advances in tele-rehabilitation using smart phone technology, widely available in rural areas, provides a means to access rehabilitation from home.\n\nReDI@Home will examine the impact of home-based e-Rehabilitation, delivered via smart phone, for rural residents living with moderate to advanced OA. This randomized feasibility trial will compare 2 e-Rehabilitation programs (eRP) of varying intensity (eRP-LOw Intensity \\[eRP-LO\\] and eRP-HIgh Intensity \\[eRP- HI\\]).\n\nThe investigators think that the eRP are feasible and that both eRP will improve OA self-management. However, eRP-HI will improve patient outcomes more than eRP-LO.",
      "detailed_description": "ReDI@Home is a randomized feasibility trial that will evaluate implementation of home-based interventions to assist persons with moderate to advanced hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) living in rural environments with self-management. Although others have used similar web-based interventions for urban patients living with inflammatory arthritis, our selected group of rural residents living with OA, has been under-served with these types of interventions, often due to internet service limitations. Following this feasibility work, a definitive randomized trial of the refined rehabilitation programs relative to usual OA care in rural settings is planned. This feasibility trial is essential before a definitive trial.\n\nOnce ReDI@Home is refined and tested, the intervention will be transferable to other provinces/settings where rural residents require rehabilitation. This approach may also work for older adults living in urban areas, whose community rehabilitation access may be limited due to physical distancing associated with COVID-19.\n\nObjectives and Hypotheses\n\nReDI@Home will examine the impact of home-based e-Rehabilitation, delivered using smart phone technology, for those living with moderate to advanced OA who reside in rural regions. This randomized feasibility trial will compare 2 e-Rehabilitation Programs (eRP):\n\neRP-LOw Intensity (eRP-LO) will be an 8-week intervention that includes FOUR virtual visits with a physiotherapist (PT) while eRP-HIgh Intensity (eRP-HI) will be an 8-week intervention with EIGHT virtual weekly visits with a PT. Both interventions will include a progressive resistance exercise program and self-management strategies. Participants will be provided with Theraband to progress exercise intensity, a FitBit to monitor physical activity, an audio-journal to promote self-reflection, and educational materials provided as part of usual OA care.\n\nReDI@Home will answer the following research questions:\n\n1. Are eRP using smart phone technology feasible for rural Albertans living with moderate to advanced OA?\n2. If feasible\n\n   1. are eRP effective?\n   2. do eRP vary in effectiveness based on intensity and participant characteristics?\n\n1\\. Feasibility will evaluate:\n\n1. Participant recruitment/participation/retention/satisfaction\n2. Treatment fidelity (delivery of eRP as intended): will be compared within and between groups.\n3. Outcomes/Outcome measure utility and responsiveness 2. Effectiveness will compare\n\na. Patient outcomes between the 2 interventions using validated measures: i. Self-management (primary effectiveness outcome) using the Patient Activation Measure ii. Lower extremity strength/balance using the 30-second Chair Stand test iii. Pain and Function using the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score(HOOS)/Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score(KOOS) and Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (iCOAP) score iv. Physical activity and the Sedentary Lifestyle Index(SLI) using FitBit-measured step count v. Change from pre-intervention using Global Rating of Change vi. Anxiety/depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) vii. Pain catastrophizing using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) viii. Social Support, Network, \\& Participation using the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA) ix. Health literacy using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) b. Responders versus non-responders in both eRP to refine selection criteria/eRP content The investigators hypothesize that the eRP will be feasible and that both eRP will improve OA self-management, but there may be non-responders in both eRP. eRP-HI will improve all patient outcomes more than eRP-LO.\n\nResearch Method/Procedures DESIGN: ReDI@Home will be a randomized, parallel-arm, single-blind (clinical assessor) feasibility trial with participants randomized to eRP-HI or eRP-LO. An uneven block randomization sequence will be computer-generated with a 1:1 group allocation. Randomization will occur after the pre-intervention visit.\n\nSCREENING: For feasibility, the investigators will determine the number of patients eligible for participation as well as the reason for ineligibility (e.g., metro Edmonton residence, technology issues \\&/or data limitations, etc.). For those eligible, but who refuse participation, reasons for refusal including apprehension with technology or privacy (e.g., having virtual video home visits with PT) will be noted. The investigators will also complete semi-structured interviews with this sub-group (See Qualitative Assessment below). Feasibility outcomes will determine the a) reach of eRP in rural areas and b) rural residents' willingness to participate in such programs. The semi-structured interviews with those refusing to participate are anticipated to be shorter in duration, 20-30 minutes. These interviews will be with those who are willing via the phone or Zoom. All interviews will be scheduled at a time convenient for the interviewer and the participant. The meetings will be set up over email or the phone and take place on Zoom or on the phone, whichever is better for the participant.\n\nENROLLMENT: Enrollment will occur during the Camrose- or Edmonton-based surgical eligibility clinic visit. Clinic staff will identify eligible patients (using the referral to identify diagnosis of OA and patient address for rural residence) and determine if they wish to talk to researchers. If the research personnel is in attendance at these clinics they will confirm eligibility, explain the study and obtain signed consent (electronic format: e-consent) from eligible volunteers. When the research personnel is not in attendance, clinic staff will determine the patients' interest in talking to researchers and will obtain their contact information using the 'consent to contact form' to pass on to the researchers. Researchers will contact patients by telephone and obtain e-consent from eligible and willing participants. For potentially eligible participants completing virtual appointments due to COVID-19, clinic staff will determine their interest in talking to researchers and will obtain the patients' contact information via phone using the 'consent to contact script' to pass on to the researchers. Researchers will contact patients by telephone and obtain e-consent from eligible and willing participants.\n\nAll participants will receive written information regarding OA management/exercises provided by the intake clinics as per usual care. They will receive a tripod to hold their smart phone/tablet, a Fitbit, and 2 Therabands of varying intensity. Research personnel will register and install the Fitbit, YARO avatar, and Zoom for Health 'apps' on participants' smart phones/tablets along with video instructions on their use; there are no costs for these apps.\n\nFor those enrolled virtually, these same items will be mailed with instruction sheets. The research coordinator will phone the participants once items are received and help them to install the apps and setup their Fitbit, YARO avatar and Zoom for Health. The investigators previously completed Fitbit setup successfully using mailed instructions (with a YouTube link) in a similar patient group (post-TJA) with phone assistance as needed.\n\nAlthough all participants will be encouraged to use the planned smartphone technology (and only be enrolled if they meet the technology eligibility criteria), as a feasibility trial, the investigators must plan for failure of the intervention technology delivered as intended in some cases. If such failure occurs (including unwillingness of patients to continue with the intervention technology), the investigators will adapt intervention delivery and research assessment to be web- or telephone-based to retain participants in the eRPs and research evaluation. Change in eRP delivery mode is included in the feasibility assessment.\n\nRESEARCH ASSESSMENT: A research associate who is not engaged with the intervention and blinded to group allocation will contact participants using secured Zoom for Health at 0-weeks (pre-intervention), 9-weeks (post-intervention) and 6- and 12-months following randomization to complete the standardized measures. At the pre-intervention assessment, socio-demographics, co-morbidities, and employment status will be collected. The 30-second Chair Stand test will only be completed if it can be done safely. Participants will connect via Zoom for Health after receiving an embedded link in an email sent by the assessor. All data will be stored on the remote secure server, not the assessor's tablet.\n\nParticipants will wear the Fitbit for 10 weeks (i.e., one- week before and during the intervention period) and then again for at least 1 week before the 6- and 12-month assessments, to measure step count- derived physical activity and SLI using their Fitbit Dashboard.\n\nRANDOMIZATION: The research coordinator will randomize participants after the equipment/software set-up and the pre-intervention assessment has been completed. The assigned intervention PT will contact participants to review the eRP and set up appointments as required based on group assignment. The investigators will use one PT for all eRP-LO participants and up to 2 PTs to provide the eRP-HI intervention. Participants will have the same PT throughout, with visits scheduled during the day or early evening at PT and participant preference/availability, as per our previous COACH study.\n\nINTERVENTION: Both eRPs will be led by PTs experienced in working with patients with hip/knee OA. Participants will attach their cellphone/tablet to the tripod selfie-stick provided at enrollment. They will receive an embedded link in an email that will connect them to a secure Zoom for Health session. The link will also connect their camera, cell phone/tablet microphone and speaker to the eRP providers' tablet. Sessions will be recorded with data stored on a secure server along with the Kinetisense data to allow assessment of change in function and gait over time as well as treatment fidelity. Both eRP will have the following components: Progressive Exercises will include an evidence-based progressive resistance training program using Theraband and bodyweight, with weekly (eRP-HI) or biweekly (eRP-LO) progression. PTs will use Kinetisense to observe exercises/gait performance and progress exercise intensity as tolerated, encouraging exercise completion at least 1-2 times between PT sessions. Self-management will include a) physical / mental / emotional self-management, and b) exercise / physical activity advice to enhance uptake. Physical activity, using the Fitbit will be measured by daily step count and energy expenditure; our recent work found that Fitbit step count and energy expenditure correlate well with a research grade accelerometer. Daily audio-journaling using YARO as an adjunct to PT interactions will promote self-reflection for mental health, encourage healthy lifestyle choices (e.g., diet, sleep, physical activity) as well as exercise compliance using a daily query about exercise performance (informal exercise log through self-report). The screening clinics' educational materials, including exercise booklets, will be provided as part of usual care.\n\neRP-Lo will include 4 sessions over 8 weeks while eRP-HI will include 8 sessions over 8 weeks, with each session lasting \\~45-60 minutes. At each visit, the PT will discuss OA self-management and review and progress exercise performance. PTs will individualize exercises to patient tolerance (i.e., patients will exercise at different intensities and progress as able) and the home environment. Delivery of the self-management content will be prioritized by the participant and PT, so that discussions focus on each participant's individual needs to personalize the approach. PTs will also encourage a) physical activity using the Fitbit as an aid to set activity goals and b) audio-journaling with YARO for self-reflection. Participants will be encouraged to exercise, increase physical activity, audio-journal and/or access educational materials between sessions using individual goal-setting to promote patient activation.\n\nUp to 20 eligible participants WHO REFUSE PARTICIPATION will be given an option to participate in a brief semi-structured interview to understand their attitudes, perceptions, and interest in participating in eRP; understanding the barriers to participation may allow refinement of the eRP improve their reach. A 'Quality of Experience' assessment will be completed with up to 20 eligible participants WHO COMPLETE THE eRPS AND PT PROVIDERS (N= 3-5) using semi-structured interviews to understand perceptions of program value, appropriateness, effectiveness, acceptability and satisfaction with the eRPs. Twenty participants from each of these populations should allow us to reach data saturation. An experienced qualitative assessor working on Tele-Rehab 2.0 will complete all interviews; this assessor is independent of eRP delivery. Interviews will be recorded and field notes (impressions noted by the interviewer), will be analyzed thematically and inductively to identify ideas, categories and themes of interest. Qualitative data will further inform eRP refinement.\n\nIn addition to the validated outcome measures, the investigators will also collect the following information at the pre- intervention interview to evaluate how patient characteristics impact eRP outcomes:\n\n* Demographics (e.g. age, sex)\n* Affected joint (hip or knee)\n* Comorbidities using the validated Canadian National Population Health Survey listing, including obesity (BMI), and socio-demographics.\n* Occupation (e.g. employed, retired, other)\n* Living Arrangements (e.g. lives alone or with others; relationship with participant)\n* Residence location (e.g. small town, farm) SAMPLE SIZE: Considering 2 groups evaluated over 4 time-points, small to medium effect size (d=0.3), moderate correlation (r=0.4) and allowing 15% attrition, the investigators will enroll 120 participants (n=60/group).",

These tubes have a \"cuff\" on the outside that is inflated in the trachea to help prevent fluids from leaking into the lungs. These cuffs come in different shapes and sizes. The TaperGuard endotracheal tube has a taper-shaped cuff that has been shown in animals to decrease the leakage of fluid past the cuff better than a traditional tube that has a barrel-shaped cuff. This study is designed to examine whether the use of the TaperGuard tube during surgery on humans decreases the amount of leakage past the cuff to a greater degree than the traditional barrel-shaped cuff. In addition, the study will investigate whether the use of the TaperGuard tube is associated with a decrease in respiratory complications often seen following surgery which may be related to fluid leaking past the cuff and into the lungs. It is thought that the use of the TaperGuard endotracheal tube will result in a decrease in fluid leakage past the cuff and that it will be associated with a decrease in respiratory complications during the 30 days after surgery.",

The TaperGuard Basic tube has a taper-shaped cuff and has been shown, via bench and animal testing, to decrease microaspiration, which has been associated with respiratory difficulties. The intraoperative use of this tube (i.e. during short term intubation), and its impact on postoperative complications and outcomes has not been investigated. This study will determine whether the intraoperative use of the TaperGuard tube results in a decrease in microaspiration compared to the Hi-Lo endotracheal tube having a barrel-shaped cuff. Moreover, the relationship between a decrease in microaspiration and subsequent decrease in postoperative respiratory complications will be explored.",

    "explanation": "Based on the provided data, the decision to repurpose the drug 'hi' is conditional. The drug has a moderate export performance with controlled volatility, indicating potential for growth in emerging markets. The therapy area shows steady research volume, and the drug has a relatively small market size with a high CAGR, indicating potential for growth. However, there are also unmet needs in the market, such as the need for improved safety profile, limited studies in pediatric population, and potential off-label benefit in new therapeutic areas. To address these needs, repurposing the drug could be a viable option. However, the top competitors in the market are well-established, and innovation and differentiation would be necessary to succeed. Therefore, a conditional decision is made, pending further analysis and evaluation of the potential benefits and challenges of repurposing the drug."

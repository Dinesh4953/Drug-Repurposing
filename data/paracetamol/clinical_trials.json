    "brief_summary": "Whereas it, in the case of conventional thoracotomy, has been demonstrated that thoracic epidural analgesia is more effective than systemic opioids in terms of pain relief and preservation of postoperative pulmonary function, the efficacy of epidural analgesia in video-assisted thoracic surgical (VATS) procedures, has not been sufficiently studied, but a beneficial effect might very well be present.\n\nOn the other hand, the risks associated with placement of a thoracic epidural catheter are well known and if similar pain relief can be achieved without it with no or only insignificant alternative side effects, this would be preferable.\n\nThe literature regarding the usefulness of epidural analgesia for reducing pain in Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery is, at best, scarce with two small studies showing some effect and two showing no difference, none of the studies being blinded randomized controlled trials of adequate size.\n\nThe SEAVATS Study will try to answer this question.",
    "detailed_description": "Study plan:\n\nThe hypothesis is that there is no difference in the amount of pain the patients will experience after VATS for pulmonary neoplasms.\n\nStudy design and setting:\n\nThe project is designed as a prospectively, double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study comparing pain in two groups of patients.\n\nBoth groups of patients will:\n\n* Have a epidural catheter placed.\n* Receive a basis level of analgesics consisting of paracetamol and a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug combined with a nerveblock placed intercostally during surgery.\n* Have access to i.v. opioids as needed for any experienced pain after surgery.\n\nOne group of patients will be given local anaesthetics through the epidural catheter supplemented with placebo medication orally while the other group will receive saline in the epidural catheter supplemented with opioids orally.\n\nData collection:\n\nData will, during hospitalization, be collected in the operating theatre, in the postoperative care unit and in the surgical ward. Six months after surgery a questionnaire will be send to the patients to do follow-up regarding residual sequelae after surgery and placement of epidural catheter. Further follow-up with questionnaire has been planned for subsequent years.\n\nAs a secondary objective, in fifty-six of the patients from The SEAVATS Study, blood samples will be gathered during surgery and one hour and 24 hours after surgery, and compared with pre-operative levels.\n\nThese blood samples will be analysed for immune cells (NK-cells, levels and activity) and cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-gamma) as indicators of immunological response to surgery.\n\nResearch ethics:\n\nThe project has obtained ethics approval from The Regional Scientific Ethical Committees for Southern Denmark and acceptance to perform clinical research has been granted by The Danish Health and Medicines Authority. Consent to data collection has been provided by The Danish Data Protection Agency. Before entering the project, consent will be obtained from all patients. Rigorous data security will be maintained for five years and afterwards all data will be deleted. The Study is registered with The European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT) with EudraCT number 2014-000760-18 and is monitored by The Good Clinical Practice unit for Southern Denmark.",

Unlike rhino-orbital mucormycosis, surgery is not feasible in several patients with pulmonary mucormycosis. Hence, treatment is primarily with antifungal therapy. Amphotericin B is the standard of care in the medical management of mucormycosis. However, amphotericin B is expensive, has significant adverse events, and is available only in parenteral formulation. Posaconazole is effective against Mucorales, and is currently approved for salvage therapy of mucormycosis. Recent evidence suggest that in several patients, posaconazole may be effective as a monotherapy upfront. In the current study posaconazole versus amphotericin B will be evaluated for the management of pulmonary mucormycosis in a randomized clinical trial.",

    "brief_summary": "Emergency department (ED) clinicians often prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage acute musculoskeletal (MSK) pain (e.g.: fracture, sprain, back pain). However, even short-term NSAIDs use can have significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, MSK and renal adverse effects. For this reason, some patients cannot take or tolerate NSAIDs. Recent evidence has shown that vitamin C has some analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties particularly in postoperative context and prevent specific types of chronic pain. Furthermore, vitamin C is safe and associated with very few adverse events. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether vitamin C can reduce pain intensity during a seven-day period following an ED visit for acute MSK pain.\n\nThe investigators propose to compare two groups of patients, one receiving 900 mg of vitamin C to another receiving a placebo, twice a day for seven days. Both groups will consume acetaminophen slow release 650 mg two pills every eight hours regularly. Naproxen 500 mg (NSAID) will be used as a rescue medication if the patient's pain is not relieved. Participants will be \u226518 years of age, treated in ED for acute MSK pain present for less than 48 hours with pain intensity at triage of \u2265 4 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale, and discharged by an ED clinician with an NSAIDs prescription without opioids. The level of pain intensity during a seven-day period will be assessed daily using an electronic or paper diary, as well as pain relief, pain medication consumption, and adverse events. Three months after the injury, participants will also be contacted to assess the presence of chronic pain. The investigators hypothesized that vitamin C will reduce pain intensity and chronic pain development at three months.\n\nThis research could provide a safe alternative to patients who are unable to take NSAIDs. It may also contribute to the reduction of the burden associated with chronic pain development.",
    "detailed_description": "Background and Importance: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have proven their efficacy and compared advantageously to opioids in treating acute musculoskeletal (MSK) pain. However, even short-term NSAIDs use for acute pain management after an emergency department (ED) discharge can have significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and renal adverse effects. Recent evidence has shown that vitamin C has, in addition to its antioxidant effect, some analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its analgesic effect has been explored mostly in short-term postoperative context or in disease-specific chronic pain prevention, but never after acute pain from MSK injuries, which are often seen in EDs.\n\nGoal(s) / Research Aims: The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin C in reducing pain intensity during a seven-day period following ED discharge for an acute MSK pain complaint. The secondary aims are to compare both treatment groups for rescue medication use, average pain relief and adverse events during a seven-day follow-up, and at three months for chronic pain incidence.\n\nMethods / Approaches / Expertise: The investigators will conduct a pragmatic five-center, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) with 546 participants equally distributed in two arms; one group receiving 900 mg of vitamin C and another one receiving a placebo, twice a day for seven days. Both groups will consume acetaminophen slow release 650 mg two pills every eight hours regularly. Naproxen 500 mg will be used as a rescue medication if the patient's pain is not relieved more than one hour after acetaminophen consumption. Participants will be aged \u226518 years, treated in the emergency department for acute MSK injury present for less than 48 hours with a pain intensity at triage of \u2265 4 on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10, and scheduled for discharge by an emergency clinician with an NSAIDs prescription without opioids. Daily pain intensity during the seven-day period will be assessed via a previously tested electronic or paper diary. In addition, patients will report their daily rescue pain medication use, pain relief, and adverse events. Three months after the ED visit, participants will be contacted to evaluate chronic pain development.\n\nThe investigators hypothesized that vitamin C will reduce pain intensity during a seven-day follow-up for ED discharged patients treated for acute MSK pain. This project brings together a committed, multidisciplinary research team composed of five study sites having previously collaborated on large multicenter RCT studies. All required instruments have been successfully used during an ongoing Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) grant, a non-objection letter from Health Canada has been already requested and the investigators have secured a provider for both study drugs, all this ensuring a rapid study implementation.\n\nExpected Outcomes: The investigators will provide the following outcomes for patients receiving vitamin C and placebo: pain intensity, rescue medication use, pain relief, and side effects for one-week post-discharge and chronic pain incidence at three months. Confirmation of the vitamin C analgesic effect for acute MSK pain could help patients who are unable to consume or are at risk of complications from NSAIDS. It may also contribute to the reduction of the burden associated with chronic pain development.",

    "phases": [

    "brief_summary": "Post-operative pain control following elective anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction continues to be a hurdle for orthopaedic surgeons. This obstacle becomes particularly problematic during the first 36 hours after the operation, when the patient is experiencing pain at its peak intensity. Good control of pain leads to better patient comfort, confidence to place weight on the operative limb and improved ability to perform critical exercises in this period to improve joint range of motion.\n\nA variety of anesthetic techniques have been employed to reduce pain including: cryotherapy, systemic analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, intrathecal, regional blockade of peripheral nerves and frequently intra-articular injections. Each technique has been studied at length with mixed but overall favorable results. However, in the authors' experience, after femoral nerve blockade, patients continue to complain of posterior knee pain in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and peri-operative period. Intra-articular injections comprised of morphine and other Na-channel blocker analgesics may curb some of this pain by bathing the posterior capsule in anesthetic. However, there is still a large concern amongst orthopaedic surgeons about the potential harm these agents may have on the knee's healthy articular cartilage surfaces. The long term effects, including chondrolysis have been documented in the shoulder and while in the short term this effect is diminished there is still hesitation among surgeons to use this form of pain blockade.\n\nThis has led the investigators to adapt a technique of isolated posterior capsular injections after total knee replacements from the joint arthroplasty literature, which has shown favorable results with low complication risk. The investigators plan to study the effectiveness of this technique during ACL reconstruction in an attempt to curb the amount of posterior knee pain and decrease the overall narcotic use postoperatively while limiting the exposure of the native cartilage to harmful agents.",
    "detailed_description": "A prospective series of consecutive patients undergoing primary ACLR will be recruited from a preoperative log of patients seeing one of two sports medicine fellowship trained surgeons within the investigators group. Patients undergoing primary unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) either with bone-patellar bone autograft or Achilles tendon allograft will be included by surgeons using similar techniques and fixation options.\n\nAfter consenting to participate, subjects will be randomized into one of two groups. Using a random number generator, 60 consecutively enrolled patients will be placed in their appropriate study arm. (Odd numbers = Control Group) (Even numbers = Experimental Group). Only the patient will be blinded to which arm of the study they belong.\n\nGroup 1(Control) patients will undergo routine arthroscopically assisted ACLR surgery with a standardized postoperative protocol. Group 2 (Experimental) patients will undergo the same procedure with the same postoperative protocols as Group 1, with the addition of the posterior capsular injection of 20 cc of Marcaine 0.5%. There are no placebo treatments being offered and the surgeons and operating room staff are not blinded to the subjects group. Injecting marcaine in this study will be performed in accordance with its standard use according to the FDA labeling/guidelines. The physicians will use their discretion as to the appropriate location for the injection into the posterior capsule of the knee which should bring no additional risks than expected for a knee injection.\n\nAt the conclusion of the case, each patient will receive a dry sterile dressing, followed by a compression wrap and a hinged knee brace locked in extension. No drains, pain pumps or nerve stimulators will be used. The nurses in the recovery room who will be administering the VAS assessment and recording time and frequency of pain medication dosing will be blinded to the patients' Group number. The nurses will provide pain medications and the visual analog assessment for their duties in the post-op anesthesia unit, and are not administering drugs or procedures specifically for research purposes.\n\nPost-operative Care All patients will be discharged home from the surgery center on the same day (within 2-3 hours) postoperatively. Patients will be made weight bearing as tolerated with crutches and a brace.\n\nWhile in the PACU, at time points 15min and 1 hour, a standardized and previously validated visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment will be delivered to the patient by the recovery room nurse.\n\nPatients after discharge will then be asked to rate their most severe pain each morning and night for 4 consecutive postoperative days using this VAS pain scale. A standardized pain medication regimen will be given including: one or two tabs of Percocet 7.5/325mg to be taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed. A log of the time and amount of medication taken each POD will be kept and recorded by the patients. Patients will also be instructed to use cryotherapy for 20 min intervals 3 times per day. Patients will also begin on POD 0 the use of continuous passive motion machines starting at a comfortable range of motion and progressing 5 degrees/day as tolerated. Patients will return for their first post-operative visit between 7-10 days where diaries will be collected and the patient clinically assessed.\n\nPatient's will also be seen at their three month post-operative visit and be clinically assessed for the presence of chondrolysis (a frequently measured outcome during knee pain medication injection studies).\n\nStatistical Analysis Based on previous studies, the Mann-Whitney U test will check differences between numeric variables. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests can compare the analgesia level in the two groups and if possible ANOVA test can compare the analgesia duration. Chi-square tests will be utilized for any potential complications which will also be recorded.\n\nPower Analysis Prelim Power Analysis per STATS department @ Cedars: sample sizes of 26 for each group (N1=N2=26) = Total 52 patients to achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the population mean difference is 2 with a standard deviation for both groups of 2.5 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.050 using a two-sided two-sample equal-variance t-test. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled to ensure the investigators achieve adequate power for the study.\n\nDespite the addition of selective regional blockade by the anesthesia team including femoral and saphenous nerve blocks, a portion of patients are still experiencing post-operative knee pain within the first few hours to days after the procedure. Pain may be a result of the femoral tunnel drilling which theoretically may be relieved by a posterior capsular injection. Eliminating this painful period will improve the patient's subjective experience undergoing surgery, and may also allow for earlier range of motion and participation in rehabilitation strengthening exercises performed by the patient in the peri-operative period.",

    "detailed_description": "Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children. Its incidence has been increasing day by day and has almost doubled since the 1970s. In recent years, with the development of surgical techniques and anesthetic approaches, significant progress has been made in the recovery and postoperative management of these patients and morbidity has decreased significantly. The most feared complications of AT in children are respiratuar complications such as laryngospasm and bronchospasm. These complications can occur during AT or in the postoperative period, requiring rapid response by the anesthesia and surgical team and extensive postoperative monitoring. They may result in increased morbidity and prolonged hospitalization. Different methods including intravenous lidocaine, topical lidocaine, propofol, iv magnesium and the like have been proposed to reduce laryngospasm; different results have been obtained in studies. Thermal softening of endotracheal tubes (ETT) with normal warm saline before intubation has been shown to be significantly effective in reducing sore throat and hoarseness during recovery and postoperatively.

Researchers will recruit 48 participants with HSP and randomly divide them into two groups:\n\nTreatment Group: Participants will receive therapy using the Postural Decryption Technique.\n\nControl Group: Participants will undergo traditional massage therapy.\n\nWhat Participants Will Do:\n\nReceive treatment 5 times per week, 40 minutes per session, for 4 weeks. Undergo evaluations before treatment, 2 weeks after treatment begins, and at the end of 4 weeks to measure pain relief and shoulder function improvement.\n\nUndergo musculoskeletal ultrasound to assess changes in soft tissue and joint structure.\n\nEvaluation Methods:\n\n1. Pain Assessment: Pain levels will be measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).\n2. Range of Motion (ROM): Tools will be used to measure the angles of shoulder movement.\n3. Postural Assessment: The position of the scapula and spine will be measured to evaluate postural alignment improvements.\n4. Daily Activity Ability: Progress in daily tasks will be recorded using the Barthel Index questionnaire.\n\nSignificance of the Study:\n\nThis study aims to validate whether the Postural Decryption Technique is a more effective and safer treatment for HSP compared to traditional massage therapy. If proven effective, it could offer a new rehabilitation approach to reduce pain, restore function, and improve the quality of life for stroke survivors.\n\nSafety Monitoring:\n\nResearchers will closely monitor participants for any signs of discomfort or adverse effects during the treatment process. Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time if they experience any issues.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe ultimate goal of this study is to identify a better treatment option for HSP in stroke patients. The results are expected to support the application of the Postural Decryption Technique as a safe and effective rehabilitation method for broader clinical use.",
    "detailed_description": "Section 1: Introduction to Postural Decryption Technique (PDT)\n\nBackground and Development:\n\nThe Postural Decryption Technique (PDT) was co-developed by Professor Won Sang-Hee from South Korea and Professor Wang Qiang from the Rehabilitation Medicine Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. This innovative rehabilitation approach integrates biomechanical assessments with precise interventions to correct joint alignment, restore muscle function, and retrain movement patterns.\n\nProfessor Wang Qiang has dedicated years to applying PDT for the treatment of shoulder joint adhesions and gait dysfunctions in patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain (HSP) after stroke. His work has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy and laid a solid foundation for the broader application of this technique in rehabilitation medicine.\n\nCore Principles and Technical Framework:\n\nPDT emphasizes the importance of postural alignment and joint stability in rehabilitation. It is based on the 4R Core Technique, which includes:\n\n1. Reposition - Correcting abnormal joint alignments to restore normal positioning and stability.\n2. Restore - Releasing soft tissue adhesions to improve muscle elasticity and flexibility.\n3. Reinforce - Strengthening key muscle groups and enhancing neuromuscular control.\n4. Retrain - Re-educating patients in functional movements to maintain proper posture and prevent recurrence.\n\nFeatures and Advantages:\n\n1. Addresses Root Causes: Unlike conventional treatments that focus on symptom relief, PDT targets the biomechanical imbalances that lead to pain and dysfunction.\n2. Personalized Approach: Treatment plans are customized based on individual postural assessments and functional limitations, ensuring optimal outcomes.\n\n   Non-Invasive Therapy: PDT is safe, painless, and well-tolerated, making it suitable for long-term application.\n3. Broad Applicability: Beyond treating HSP, PDT has shown positive results in managing chronic pain, gait impairments, and spinal deformities such as scoliosis.\n\nSection 2: Study Design\n\nStudy Framework:\n\nThis study adopts a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of PDT in treating HSP. It also compares PDT with traditional massage therapy to determine the superior approach.\n\nParticipants:\n\nA total of 48 eligible participants diagnosed with HSP will be randomly assigned into two groups:\n\nPDT Group (Treatment Group): Participants will undergo therapy using the Postural Decryption Technique.\n\nTraditional Massage Group (Control Group): Participants will receive standard massage therapy.\n\nIntervention Methods:\n\nPostural Decryption Technique (PDT Group):\n\nEvaluation: Analyze scapular alignment, thoracic posture, and joint biomechanics to identify dysfunctions.\n\n4R Protocol: Apply repositioning, soft tissue release, muscle reinforcement, and movement retraining.\n\nFocus Areas:\n\nJoint Mobilization: Sliding and stretching of the glenohumeral joint to improve range of motion.\n\nMuscle Relaxation: Release tight muscles (e.g., pectoralis minor, serratus anterior).\n\nScapular Stabilization: Proprioception exercises to enhance balance and neuromuscular control.\n\nFunctional Retraining: Teach proper movement patterns to maintain postural alignment.\n\nTraditional Massage Therapy (Control Group):\n\nSoft tissue relaxation techniques (kneading, pressing). Passive joint mobilization for improved flexibility. Pain relief methods, such as acupressure and trigger point therapy.\n\nTreatment Duration:\n\n5 sessions per week, 40 minutes per session, for 4 weeks. Adjustments to intensity and methods will be made based on participant progress.\n\nOutcome Assessments:\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n\nPain Relief (VAS): Visual Analog Scale (0-10) to measure pain intensity. Range of Motion (ROM): Goniometer to assess flexion, abduction, and extension angles.\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n\nFunctional Independence (Barthel Index): Measures daily activity performance, scored 0-100.\n\nPostural Symmetry: Vertical distance between scapular angles and the second thoracic vertebra, evaluated for alignment improvement.\n\nMusculoskeletal Ultrasound: Tracks changes in muscle structure, tendon thickness, and joint effusion.\n\nSafety Monitoring:\n\nRecord adverse events, such as increased pain, swelling, or loss of function. Allow participants to withdraw at any stage if discomfort occurs.",

    "detailed_description": "The treatment for patients with uncomplicated myocarditis (left ventricular ejection fraction \\>50% without heart failure) is not currently well defined. Analgesic drugs are commonly used to manage pain. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) among analgesics is controversial due to potential harmful effects observed in animal models. However, NSAIDs are the standard treatment for pericarditis, even when it is associated with mild myocardial involvement. In patients with acute myocarditis and normal left ventricular ejection fraction, observational studies have suggested that NSAIDs may have a beneficial effect in reducing late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) measured in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), an important prognostic marker in this population.\n\nWe plan to conduct a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NSAIDs versus conventional analgesic treatment in patients with uncomplicated acute myocarditis and left ventricular ejection fraction \u226550%.\n\nApproximately 150 patients will be randomized 1:1 to NSAID treatment (ibuprofen tapering schedule during 3 weeks) or conventional treatment (acetaminophen or metamizole in case of allergy until pain resolution) during hospital admission. Patients will be followed for a 12-month period. Baseline CMR will be performed at initial hospitalization for acute myocarditis and at 3 and 6 months.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the utility of ibuprofen versus conventional treatment with analgesics in acute myocarditis with preserved LVEF, in terms of reducing LGE on CMR at 6-month follow-up compared to baseline.",

Sixty patients aged 18-75 years, with stable cardiopulmonary function and a baseline visual analog scale (VAS) pain score \\<3, will be enrolled and randomly allocated into the intervention and control groups. The intervention group will receive TENS stimulation based on the Wrist-Ankle Acupuncture theory 10 minutes before the colonoscopy, with a frequency of 2 Hz and adjustable current intensity ranging from 1 to 9 mA. The control group will receive minimal-intensity sham stimulation under identical conditions. All participants will wear EEG-fNIRS devices to monitor neural activity in key pain-related brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, motor cortex, and parietal cortex. Primary outcomes include EEG-fNIRS data, while secondary outcomes are VAS scores at the four colonic bends, colonoscopy duration, and the correlation between EEG-fNIRS signals and pain perception. Statistical analyses will include multivariable linear regression, generalized estimating equations, and mixed-effects models to investigate the analgesic effects and neural mechanisms of TENS-WAA.

    "detailed_description": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is regarded as the gold standard minimally invasive surgical method for treating gallstones and cholecystitis. This approach offers significant advantages over open surgery, including lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and faster postoperative recovery. Nevertheless, postoperative recovery and the risk of complications remain important concerns.\n\nThe Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol is a comprehensive approach developed to accelerate postoperative recovery and reduce complications. It includes numerous components applied during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods, all aiming to shorten recovery time and enhance patient comfort.\n\nA key element of ERAS protocols in surgical practice is pain management. Postoperative pain directly affects both the psychological and physiological recovery of surgical patients and is a critical clinical issue regarding treatment response and quality of life. Inadequate pain control may lead to delayed early mobilization, prolonged hospital stays, the development of chronic pain, and an increased risk of side effects associated with heightened opioid use. The concurrent use of multiple analgesic drugs or techniques, each targeting different pain mechanisms, has been advocated to reduce opioid-related side effects while enhancing analgesia through additive or synergistic effects. The primary goal is generally to reduce or entirely eliminate the use of potent opioids, which are associated with numerous disadvantages and unacceptable side effects.\n\nThe American Pain Society (APS), in a guideline prepared by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), has recommended the implementation of multimodal analgesia in pain management strategies. The guideline strongly recommends, with high-quality evidence, that patients without contraindications receive paracetamol and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as part of multimodal analgesia for postoperative pain management. It further indicates that paracetamol and NSAIDs possess different mechanisms of action, and their combination may be more effective than either drug alone. Additionally, the guideline advises clinicians to consider regional local anesthetic infiltration at the surgical site, supported by evidence of its efficacy (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). The infiltration of long-acting local anesthetics in the surgical area has proven effective as a component of multimodal analgesia in various procedures.\n\nOverall, research on multimodal analgesia has encountered difficulties in yielding consistent results due to variability in the types of analgesics used, their dosages, and drug combinations. Since some of these techniques are relatively new while others are still under development, further research is needed to fully ascertain the synergistic effects of multimodal analgesia strategies. Moreover, there is limited literature regarding the clinical efficacy of combinations involving three or more analgesics.\n\nIn light of these findings, there is a clear need for comprehensive research on multimodal analgesia strategies. Based on the recommendations of ERAS guidelines, this study was conceived to contribute to the literature by determining the synergistic analgesic efficacy achievable through the combination of different pain management mechanisms. Specifically, the efficacy of administering paracetamol and NSAIDs at appropriate times and dosages, along with the effectiveness of local anesthetic infiltration targeted at the surgical site for postoperative pain control, will be investigated. This study aims to evaluate the effects of ERAS protocol-based multimodal analgesia principles on postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, complications, and additional opioid requirements in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\nMethods\n\nThis non-randomized controlled study (an Ambispective Cohort Study) will be conducted on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the general surgery clinic of a private hospital. The implementation of evidence-based ERAS protocols in the hospital has provided an opportunity to compare these protocols with the standard procedures performed previously. Thus, the study will involve prospectively observing patients managed according to the ERAS pain protocol (observation group) and retrospectively analyzing records of patients managed with the routine protocol before the implementation of ERAS (control group). The primary outcome is the evaluation of pain, while the secondary outcomes include hospital length of stay, early complication rates, and additional opioid requirements. The retrospective control group will consist of patients who received routine pain management in 2024, whereas the prospective observation group will consist of patients receiving the ERAS multimodal analgesia protocol between April and July 2025.\n\nNo premedication is administered to participants for sedation. Patients are routinely monitored in the operating room using standard procedures, including heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), electrocardiogram (ECG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO\u2082), and body temperature monitoring with an esophageal probe. A standardized general anesthesia protocol is administered to all patients by an experienced anesthesiologist. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) is not used. After post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) monitoring, patients are transferred to the clinical ward. These procedures apply to both groups.",

    "detailed_description": "Prospective, Randomized Study Bariatric surgery has been widely used in the treatment of obesity in recent years. It has been shown to be effective in reaching the ideal weight and reducing obesity-induced comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is defined as the first-step bariatric surgery for patients in the high surgical risk group. It has been shown that the laparoscopic approach has lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and earlier mobilization compared to open surgery. However, postoperative pain management is very important because it might cause major morbidity, especially pulmonary complications in the early postoperative period.\n\nGeneral recommendations for bariatric surgery include multimodal analgesia without sedatives, local analgesic infiltration, and early mobilization. Opioid analgesics are often preferred for pain management because of their strong analgesic potentials. However, opioids have undesirable adverse effects such as sedation, dizziness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, physical dependence and addiction, hyperalgesia, immunologic and hormonal dysfunction, muscle rigidity, tolerance, and respiratory depression. The morbidly obese patients treated with opioids experience increased risk for adverse effects such as atelectasis, which causes postoperative pulmonary complications, and obstructive sleep apnea, which causes hypoxemia, postoperative ileus and longer hospital stay due to nausea and vomiting. For this reason, in 2006, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) suggested minimizing or avoiding opioids during perioperative and/or postoperative pain management to the bariatric patients. Therefore, ASA recommends the use of multimodal analgesia including local anesthesia, regional anesthesia and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nThe ultrasound (US) guided erector spina plane (ESP) block is a novel interfacial plan block defined by Forero et al. at 2016. ESP block provides thoracic analgesia at T5 level and abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level. The ESP block contains a local anesthetic injection into the deep fascia of erector spinae. This area is away from the pleural and neurological structures and thus minimizes the risk of complications due to injury. Visualization of sonoanatomy with US is easy, and the spread of local anesthesic agents can be easily seen under the erector spinae muscle. Thus, analgesia occurs in several dermatomes with cephalad-caudad way. Cadaveric studies have shown that the injection spreads to the ventral and dorsal roots of the spinal nerves and creates sensory blockade in both posterior and anterolateral thorax. In the literature, it has been reported that ESP block provides effective analgesia after ventral hernia repair surgery in a randomized controlled study. In some case series and case reports it has been reported that ESP block provides effective analgesia after abdominal and bariatric surgeries. In the literature, there is not still any randomized study evaluating ESP block efficiency for postoperative analgesia management after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided ESP block for postoperative analgesia management following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The primary aim is to compare postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), adverse effects related with opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).",

    "detailed_description": "Anaesthesia for craniotomy surgery focuses on maintaining cerebral perfusion, avoiding factors that may lead to increased intracranial pressure and aim for early postoperative neurological recovery. In recent decades, opioids have always been a mainstay for perioperative pain management and play an important role as the standard of care - opioid-based anaesthesia (OBA). However, opioid use poses a significant number of adverse effects such as respiratory depression, prolonged sedation, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pruritus, ileus, urinary retention, and hyperalgesia. This should be avoided in patients who undergo craniotomy as they can lead to an inaccurate neurological examination because of excessive sedation and have the potential to mask early signs of intracranial complications. Besides, opioid-induced respiratory depressions cause hypercapnia which increases cerebral blood flow and may lead to cerebral oedema. Opioid-induced PONV leads to a spike in intracranial pressure which can be detrimental for post-craniotomy patients. Despite this, adequate pain management is vital as suboptimal pain control drives sympathetic efflux, promoting hypertension that may increase morbidity and mortality through intracranial haemorrhage. In view of this, recent studies on anaesthesia for craniotomy has noted a paradigm shift towards opioid-sparing or opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) to prevent opioid-related adverse effects which might prolong patients' recovery post-craniotomy. Multi-modal analgesia is also incorporated in many practices nowadays to achieve optimal intraoperative and post-craniotomy pain control. In order to guide anaesthesiologists' dosing of hypnotics and analgesics to provide appropriate depth of anaesthesia and adequate pain control, as well as to prevent under or overdosing, CONOX monitor might be used intraoperatively to measure hypnotic effect (qCon) and probability of response to noxious stimulus (qNox).\n\nThis prospective randomised controlled trial clinical study will take place in neurosurgical operation theatres and neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) of University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to compare intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of patients who undergo elective supratentorial craniotomy with opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) and those with opioid-based anaesthesia (OBA).",

Its common use (particularly in oral form) is underscored by its wide therapeutic window, safety profile, over the counter accessibility, lack of adverse systemic effects (as compared with NSAIDS and opioids) when given in appropriate doses.\n\nAlthough the exact anti-nociceptive mechanisms of acetaminophen continue to be elucidated, these mechanisms appear to be multi-factorial and include central inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme leading to decreased production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, interference with serotonergic descending pain pathways, indirect activation of cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors and inhibition of nitric oxide pathways through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or substance P. Of the above mechanisms, the most commonly known is that of central inhibition of COX enzymes by which the decreased production of prostaglandins diminish the release of excitatory transmitters of substance P and glutamate which are both involved in nociceptive transmission (Anderson, 2008; Smith, 2011).\n\nTo date, several studies have shown acetaminophen's opioid sparing effect in the pediatric population when given by the rectal or intravenous routes (Korpela et al, 1999; Dashti et al, 2009; Hong et al, 2010).",

    "brief_summary": "In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. An initial cluster of infections was linked to Huanan seafood market, potentially due to animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred and the disease, now termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread within China and all over the world. A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV, was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the new lung disease. The causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).",
    "detailed_description": "Selected Drugs\n\nHydroxychloroquine (an analog of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions. Hydroxychloroquine has long-term safety (600 mg/day for 12 to 18 months was safe). Hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibited both the entry, transport and the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the chloroquine, and one study found Hydroxychloroquine to be a more potent agent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine acts as a weak base that can change the pH of acidic intracellular organelles including endosomes/lysosomes, essential for the membrane fusion. Besides, the significant decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory markers and cytokines with Hydroxychloroquine has made this agent a successful disease modifying anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. An additional issue to be considered in severely sick patients is cytokine storm associated with disease severity of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThere are no currently available data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of Hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although optimal dosing and duration of Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotally different Hydroxychloroquine dosing such as 400 mg twice daily on day one, then daily for 5 days; 400 mg twice daily on day one, then 200 mg twice daily for 4 days; 600 mg twice daily on day one, then 400 mg daily on days 2-5. In a recent clinical trial, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during ten days was used in patients with COVID-19.\n\nNitazoxanide is originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent and has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity undergoing development for the treatment of influenza and other viral respiratory infections. In addition to its antiviral activity, Nitazoxanide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nitazoxanide could improve outcomes in patients infected with MERS-CoV by suppressing overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. Nitazoxanide has been tested in clinical setting for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza, where the subjects received either 600 or 300 mg of Nitazoxanide or placebo orally twice daily for five days and were followed for 28 days. Subjects who received Nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily experienced shorter times to alleviation of symptoms compared with subjects who received 300 mg Nitazoxanide twice daily, which in turn, was shorter than placebo.\n\nAccording to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, there is lack of effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19. Nearly all patients who suffered from COVID-19-associated pneumonia accepted oxygen therapy and WHO recommended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to patients with refractory hypoxemia. Rescue treatment with convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin G are delivered to some critical cases according to their condition.\n\nThe rationale of the use of Hydoxychloroquine and Nitazoxanide combination for treatment of COVID-19 infected patients is based on the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of the selected drugs. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of the disease.\n\nDiagnostic criteria\n\nThe viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary identification of the SARS-CoV-2 through the classical Koch's postulates and observing its morphology through electron microscopy. So far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of COVID-19 is nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by real-time PCR and further confirmation by next-generation sequencing.\n\nSide effects of Hydroxychloroquine\n\n* The most common adverse effects are mild nausea and occasional stomach cramps with mild diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting\n* The most serious adverse effects are retinopathy and heart problems\n* Long term use may cause liver toxicity Contraindications of Hydroxychloroquine\n* Heart conditions, diabetes or psoriasis.\n* The drug transfers into breast milk so should be used with care by pregnant or nursing women\n\nInteractions of Hydroxychloroquine\n\n* Antacids may decrease the absorption of Hydroxychloroquine.\n* Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of Hydroxychloroquine.\n* There may be a link between Hydroxychloroquine and hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.\n* Digoxin; concomitant administration with Hydroxychloroquine may result in increased serum digoxin levels.\n* Insulin or antidiabetic drugs; concomitant administration with Hydroxychloroquine may enhance the effects of the hypoglycemic treatment.\n* Hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and may increase the risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if used concurrently with other arrhythmogenic drugs.\n* Mefloquine and other drugs that lower the convulsive threshold, when co-administered with Hydroxychloroquine, there may be an increased risk of convulsions.\n* Concurrent use of Hydroxychloroquine with antiepileptics may impair the antiepileptic activity.\n* Cyclosporin when used concomitantly with Hydroxychloroquine, an increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported.\n\nSide effects of Nitazoxanide\n\nThe most common adverse effects are GIT as nausea and occasional stomach cramps with mild diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting. Nervous system side effects as headache, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, tremor, and hypesthesia have been reported in less than 1% of the patients.\n\nContraindications of Nitazoxanide\n\nThere are no data on the excretion of Nitazoxanide into human milk. The manufacturer recommends that caution be used when administering Nitazoxanide to nursing women.\n\nTizoxanide (the active metabolite of Nitazoxanide) is highly bound to plasma protein (\\> 99.9%). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor for adverse reactions when administering Nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin).\n\nWarning\n\nNitazoxanide should be used with caution in patients with significant renal and hepatic impairment.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThe pandemic disease COVID-19 is particularly of major importance in Egypt where a heavy population lives. There is an acute need for comprehensive, continuous, and cost-effective health care delivery for infected people. Early detection and strategies for prevention of progression of COVID-19 would make a major difference for these patients and would also be economically beneficial for a resource-constrained country.\n\nThis research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug combination for possible treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. This drug combination may help to prevent the progression of respiratory complications. This can be achieved through different goals as follows:\n\n1. Screening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on its possible activity against COVID-19 virus.\n2. Providing cost-effective and easy-to-implement treatment strategy for infected patients and/or patients with high risk of developing respiratory failure.\n3. Finally, this clinical strategy remains an important goal in improving the Egyptian health state which can save people life and save a lot of money.\n\nScope of Work\n\nThe scope of work will be conducted through:\n\n1. Use of new drug combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Nitazoxanide for treatment of COVID-19 infected people. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of the disease.\n2. Evaluation of the effect of new drug combination on the symptomatic treatment of newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients through a clinical trial designed according to WHO (clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is suspected) interim guidance published at 13 March 2020.\n3. Investigating the impact of new drug combination on the prevention of severe compilations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

    "detailed_description": "1 Hypotheses and aims: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous paracetamol in pain medication for small preterm infants in a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. The primary outcome of the pain medication arm is the need for morphine medication (doses). The secondary outcomes are paracetamol serum concentrations, the side effects of paracetamol (possible hepatic dysfunction), neonatal and long-term morbidity, and mortality.\n\nThe primary outcome in the phase 2 ductus study-arm was diminishing of the ductal caliber at 5 days postnatal age. This study arm has been finalized and the results were published on 2016 (H\u00e4rkin et al).\n\nHypotheses:\n\nI. Hypothesis. Early, intravenous paracetamol is effective and safe therapy in the relief of pain and discomfort of a preterm infant.\n\nII. Hypothesis. Paracetamol levels of a preterm infant remain in safety limits with study dosages.\n\nIII. Hypothesis. Early, intravenous paracetamol does not increase long-term morbidity in preterm infants.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Aim: to evaluate in a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, the efficacy and safety of the early (\\<24 h), intravenous paracetamol in pain treatment of a preterm infant.\n2. Aim: to evaluate the safety of the early (\\<24 h), intravenous paracetamol in preterm infants requiring intensive care.\n3. Aim: to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of paracetamol in a preterm infants\n4. Aim: to evaluate the long-term effects of the early (\\<24 h), intravenous paracetamol in preterm infants requiring intensive care.\n\n2 Study permissions: The research plan is registered to the investigational diary of the Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital (diary number 100-2013). For the present trial, the permissions from The Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital district's Ethical Board and Oulu University Hospital's administrative officials have been applied and granted. The study permission has been applied and granted from Fimea, the Finnish Medicines Agency. The amendment of the research plan was approved on 30.4.2018. This project has been assigned to EudraCT network (European Clinical Trials Database), Eudra CT number 2013-008142-33, and the international ClinicalTrials.gov registry, identification number NCT01938261.\n\nWritten informed consent is asked by the primary investigators of the study from all study patients' parents. The present clinical trial is managed by the principles of Good Clinical Practice, GCP (Fimea, act 2/2012, Clinical drug trials). The essential changes of the research plan are announced to Fimea according to the Drug legislation act 87a, using the European commission internet site (http://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/eudralex/vol-10/).\n\n3 Sample size: The sample size calculation for the pain medication trial was checked after the first randomization. According to our previous study (H\u00e4rm\u00e4 et al, 2016), non-exposed premature infants received approximately 5 doses of morphine (SD 12) during their stay in the NICU. In order to treat infants without opioids, the clinical difference was approximated to be 6 doses. Therefore, with 20% power and 0.05 alpha-error, 126 infants (63/group) were required.\n\n4 Study patients and exclusion criteria: This study will recruit all the intubated premature infants born less than 32 weeks of gestational age managed in Oulu University Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. The deadline for recruitment and administration of the first dose of the study drug is postnatal age of 24 hours. The study exclusion criteria are severe structural, or chromosomal abnormality, and other severe clinical situation, which essentially affects the small premature infants' conventional early-stage treatment, e.g. severe asphyxia or persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN).\n\n5 Randomization and blinding: As the informed consent is given, the study patient receives a trial number from the list made prior to the entry of the study. The trial number will match with an envelope where has been drawn a leaflet with the patient's study medication group written on it. Placebo, 0.45 % saline, is similar to paracetamol, both being clear liquids, so the staff will remain unaware which drug the patient receives. The study medication will be kept and prepared at the ward 55 in a separate office, in a locked cabinet. The study drug will be prepared by the study nurse, or by a nurse who does not participate in the study patients' treatment in any way.\n\n6 Intervention: Masked study drug is 10 mg/ml paracetamol solution (Paracetamol Kabi Pharmacia\u00ae). Placebo is 0.45% saline solution, which does not enhance the potential small preterm infants' early-stage hypernatremia or hyperglycemia. Both are visually similar, clear solutions. Loading dose, 20 mg/kg, is followed by a maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours, for four days. According to the earlier phase 1 studies, this dose is considered to be safe for small preterm infant. The drug is administered as a 15-minute infusion. No other paracetamol preparations are allowed to be given simultaneously with the study drug. After the intervention, the use of paracetamol should be restricted as far as it is possible. If the patient's clinical condition requires starting of paracetamol medication, there should be at least two days absence of paracetamol after the last dose of study medication. Half-life of intravenous paracetamol in neonates is about 4.5 hours. No other restrictions on the patient's therapy are set. After the study intervention, the patient is treated by the attending physicians' clinical judgment. Whenever necessary, the patient will be given the normal dose of morphine, 0.1 mg/kg.\n\n6.1 Monitoring of the pain symptoms: The pain or discomfort of the patients will be screened using NIAPAS scoring before and after the study drug administration. According to the NIAPAS guidelines, values \\>5 indicate the need for evaluation for pain relief, either with using the non-medical pain relief methods, or increasing the pain medication dose. All the study patients will receive necessary pain medication during the study which would be morphine ad 0.1 mg/kg single doses, or morphine infusion. All morphine doses given during and after the intervention are recorded and calculated as the cumulative dosage.\n\n7 Paracetamol safety: Using the study drug dosage, no signs of liver or renal failure have been described before. In addition, in the recent retrospective analysis among the study unit patient population, none of the preterm infants who received paracetamol showed any clinical or laboratory signs of either complication. No increased levels of liver transaminases, bilirubin or creatinine were detected.\n\nIn paracetamol intoxication, the hepatic failure is caused by a paracetamol metabolite, not paracetamol itself. Thus, the symptoms of intoxication are not immediately evident. The hepatic tissue damage can be prevented administering the paracetamol antidote as soon as possible. Even a suspicion of a possible intoxication in an otherwise symptom-free patient is to be taken seriously. This situation should be cautiously clarified, and, if necessary, the antidote started vigorously.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol intoxication include:\n\n* During the first 24 hours, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, and perspiration may be manifested.\n* 24-48 h after the overdose, the signs of it may be seen in the laboratory examinations: bilirubin and hepatic transaminase levels increase, and the prothrombin time lengthens (INR increases; this may happen without hepatic failure if the synthesis of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors is inhibited). Diuresis may be diminished due to possible dehydration (vomiting), renal failure, and the antidiuretic action of paracetamol.\n* 2-5 days later, the liver and renal tissue damage develops. In the patients with hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis is usually seen.\n\nEarly acetyl cysteine therapy (\\<16 h after the overdose) may inhibit the hepatic failure, but even when started later, the tissue damage may be restricted. If necessary, the Poison Information Centre is consulted about the individualized instructions for treatment. The initial treatment includes intravenous fluid therapy in order to correct the acidosis, and the goal for the diuresis would be \\>1.5 ml/kg/h. The intravenously administered study medication cannot cause any harmful effects to the patients' relatives, the hospital staff, or the environment.\n\n8 Monitoring, reporting and follow-up of the possible side effects: All study patients will be monitored for signs of possible side effects, especially the signs of hepatic or renal dysfunction. During the first postnatal days, serum bilirubin levels and diuresis will be followed. If a patient had prolonged or otherwise pronounced jaundice, the abdominal ultrasound would be performed. Any evidence of hepatic or renal dysfunction would be an indication to withdraw the study medication, and to measure the hepatic transaminases and creatinine concentrations. Symptomatic hepatic or renal failure is defined as an emergency when the blinding code could be opened and the study discontinued.\n\nAll harmful events and suspected side effects are individually evaluated for possible association to the study drug. The associations are classified: certain - likely - unlikely - not possible. The harmful events that are classified significant (SUSAR) are listed by the responsible investigator. Of the serious and unexpected harmful events, death or mortal danger are announced to Fimea within seven days after the incidence and the others within 15 days. The list of the harmful events is delivered to Fimea every year.\n\n9 Pharmacokinetics: From those study patients with an arterial cannula, a single 1 ml blood sample at 48 hours postnatal age will be collected to evaluate paracetamol serum concentrations and the biological effects of prematurity. Of all the routine blood samples, any remaining droplets are retained for paracetamol concentration measurements.\n\n10 Data collection: The study data will be collected using Centricity Critical Care Clinisoft software (GE Healthcare). All the data is confidential. All the study personnel are involved with confidentiality. The computed data is collected into the hospital's intranet station O. Study papers are mapped, and kept in the room of the responsible investigator. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has been informed about the study register. The study results will be published in international, peer-reviewed medical literature, and in medical theses.\n\n11 Quality control: An external study monitor, observing the quality of the methods used and the fulfillment of the study patients' rights, has been named.\n\n12 Long-term follow-up: For the first year after discharge from hospital, the patients will be examined every three months at the follow-up clinic. Patients will be examined the clinical status, basic laboratory parameters, and if necessary, radiographic studies.\n\n13 Statistical analyses: The intention-to-treat principle is applied in all analyzes. P-value \\<.05 will be considered significant. Statistical analyzes will be made using the IBM SPSS software.",

    "brief_summary": "Ventral hernia repair is associated with significant postoperative pain, and regional anesthetic techniques are of potential benefit.\n\nThe postoperative mobility and training is of utmost importance in this patient group, and could be increased using local anesthetics instead of opioids.\n\nInadequate post-operative pain control can lead to adverse consequences for patients, such as the development of chronic pain, immunosuppression, poorer healing of surgical wounds, as well as adrenergic activation and its consequences in the form of coronary incidents or gastrointestinal obstruction and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Moreover, lack of mobility can result in thrombosis and embolism. These complications affect hospital functioning, which leads to decreased patient satisfaction, a worse reputation for the hospital, longer stays in the recovery room, prolonged hospitalizations, higher incidence of re-surgeries and re-admissions, and higher costs for care and treatment.\n\nErector spinae plane block (ESPB) is the latest of the truncal blocks and was first described in 2016. The efficacy of bilateral ESPB at the T7 level has been described in a study of 4 cases, moreover effective analgesia with ESPB after bariatric surgery has been described in a study of 3 cases. When performed at the level of the T7 transverse process, studies show the potential to block both supra-umbilical and infra-umbilical dermatomes. So far there are mostly case studies done in this field of study, and internationally there is a call for research into the effect of this technique and randomized controlled trials.\n\nThe objective of this study is to compare ESPB to multimodal analgesia in patients undergoing ventral hernia repair.",
    "detailed_description": "Hypothesis, aims and objectives\n\nThe postulated nullhypothesis and alternativ hypothesis is:\n\nH0= there is no difference in opioid consumption postoperatively between multimodal analgesia and ESPB. HA= there is a reduction in opioid consumption postoperatively between standard multimodal analgesia and ESPB.\n\nSample size calculation\n\nSample size estimation was calculated from our series of 20 pilot-patients on ventral hernia surgery without block, who needed on average 24.6 mg oral morphine equivalents (OME) iv oxycodone rescue analgesia during the first hour, SD=17.35 mg. Assuming a one sided study and in order to show a 50% reduction in rescue opioid consumption after a successful block with 80% power and 0.05 as level of significance, at least 2 x 26 patients should be studied, total of 52 patients. In order to adjust for missing data and protocol violations we decided to include 2 x 30 patients in our study.\n\nThis is a study where all parties are blinded for the allocation. A study nurse draws up the allocated study medication in an unmarked syringe so that the anesthesiologist is blinded. The study nurse responsible for the medication is not the same nurse that does the postoperative scoring. The study nurse responsible for the medication puts masked containers of the allocated medication into opaque envelopes and delivers the envelope to the ward. The ward personnel will then be masked for the allocation. The study nurse responsible for the follow up calls are not the same study nurse responsible for the medications and as such is also blinded for the allocation.\n\nThe primary outcome measure is the opiate consumption measured in oral morphine equivalents after 1 hour.\n\nSecondary outcome measures are;\n\n* Opiate consummation after 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days. As patients receive different types of opiates, opiate consumption will be measured as oral morphine equivalents for ease of comparison. Oksykodon iv is converted by a factor of 1:1,5 to oral morphine.\n* Time to first mobilization\n* Time to first analgesic requirement\n* Pain measuring tool used in this project is the validated numerical rating scale (NRS), which is a 11- point scale from 0-10, where no pain is NRS=0, mild pain is NRS 1-3, moderate pain NRS 4-6 and severe pain 7-10. NRS will be measured at rest and with activity at the time points 1, 2 and 3 hours.\n* Sedation is measured by the validated Pasero opioid-induced sedation scale (POSS). The POSS measures normal sleep as S and then the degree of sedation on a numerical scale from 1-4. Will be measured at 1, 2 and 3 hours.\n* Nausea and vomiting is measured by the validated PONV impact scale. This is a tool that entails two questions about nausea and vomiting, and each question gets rated on a numeric scale from 0-4. Will be measured at 1, 2 and 3 hours.\n\nAfter the operation the patients will be asked to answer the QoR-15, which consist of 15 questions distributed on two dimensions: \"physical\" and \"mental\" well-being, where the patients report their experiences on a scale from 0 (=not at all) to 10 (=all the time). As a complementing measure to the QoR-15 the patients will also be asked the EQ-5D questionnaire. The EQ-5D questionnaire is an outcome measure of patient health after operation. The EQ-5D-5L is comprised of two different measures; the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). Both QoR-15 and EQ-5D will be measured at 48 hours and 7 days.\n\nThe objective is to gain knowledge to support anesthesiologists when deciding analgesic approach, as well as in shared decision-making with patients (including the patient perspective). All results are expected to be presented during the project period.",

Effective postoperative analgesia is crucial for early mobilization and functional recovery. Uncontrolled postoperative pain can delay recovery, increase the risk of opioid dependence, and lead to respiratory complications.\n\nAlthough opioid analgesics effectively reduce pain, they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and dependency. Therefore, non-opioid analgesic methods are preferred for patient safety and comfort. Recently, regional anesthesia techniques such as the Thoracolumbar Interfascial Plane (TLIP) block and the Quadro Iliac Plane Block have been introduced for postoperative pain management in lumbar surgeries. However, there are not enough studies comparing the superiority of these two methods.\n\nStudy Objective: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of ultrasound-guided TLIP and Quadro Iliac Plane Blocks on postoperative opioid consumption after lumbar microsurgery. The secondary aim is to compare opioid-related side effects (such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, etc.) and postoperative NRS pain scores between the groups.",
    "detailed_description": "Lumbar microdiscectomy is a widely performed surgical procedure for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation. Ensuring optimal analgesia during the postoperative period is crucial for promoting functional recovery and early mobilization. Inadequate control of postoperative pain may delay the healing process, increase the risk of opioid dependence, and lead to respiratory complications.\n\nAlthough opioid analgesics are effective in alleviating pain during the postoperative period, they can cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and an increased risk of dependence. Therefore, the implementation of non-opioid analgesic strategies is essential for maintaining patient safety and comfort. In recent years, regional anesthesia techniques, including the Thoracolumbar Interfascial Plane block and the Quadro Iliac Plane Block, have been utilized for postoperative pain management in lumbar surgeries. However, there is insufficient evidence directly comparing the effectiveness of these two methods.\n\nPurpose of the Study: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of ultrasound-guided Thoracolumbar Interfascial Plane and Quadro Iliac Plane Blocks on postoperative opioid consumption following lumbar microsurgery. Additionally, the secondary objective is to compare the incidence of opioid-related side effects (such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression) and patients' postoperative pain scores, measured using the Numeric Rating Scale, between the two groups.",

Randomization in Part 2: 2 to 1, with approximately forty-two participants randomized to elotuzumab plus prednisone taper, and twenty-one participants randomized to placebo for elotuzumab plus prednisone taper.\n\nThe total duration of participation for each participant in this trial will be 48 weeks (11 months).",
    "detailed_description": "Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic fibro-inflammatory condition that can affect virtually every organ system, including the pancreas, biliary tract, salivary and lacrimal glands, orbits, lungs, kidneys, meninges, pituitary gland, prostate and thyroid. It may also involve the retroperitoneum. This multi-organ immune-mediated condition, once regarded as a group of isolated, single-organ diseases, is now recognized to be an overarching, single-disease entity linked by common histopathological and immunohistochemical features.\n\nIgG4-RD tends to afflict middle-aged to elderly individuals. Although IgG4-RD can affect a single organ at presentation, it is not uncommon for participants to present with or develop multi-organ disease. As the disease progresses, additional organs develop lesions and the cellular inflammation characterizing early disease moves toward a more fibrotic stage, causing major tissue damage, dysfunction and ultimately organ failure. It is unclear whether IgG4 itself is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nThe goals of IgG4-RD treatment are to reduce inflammation and organ swelling and to prevent or reverse tissue fibrosis. No approved therapy exists for IgG4-RD.\n\nThis study will enroll adult participants who meet the 2019 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Classification Criteria for IgG4-RD, and who have active IgG4-RD with disease manifestations in at least two organ systems.\n\nPrimary study objectives:\n\n* To determine the safety and tolerability of the addition of elotuzumab to prednisone in participants with IgG4-RD, and\n* To compare the effect of the addition of elotuzumab versus placebo to prednisone on the IgG4-RD Responder Index (IgG4-RD RI), a measure of IgG4-RD disease activity.",

    "brief_summary": "Overprescribing opioids is considered a major contributor to the opioid crisis. Hill et al. demonstrated that within a general surgery practice, over 70% of the prescribed opioid pills were never taken. Disturbingly, 45% of patients who did not take opioids at all on their day of discharge were discharged with an opioid prescription (Chen et al). Recent initiatives have attempted to utilize restrictive opioid prescribing protocols for postoperative pain management in which patients were prescribed a limited number of opioid tablets (Hallway et al) or prescribed opioids only if they were used as an inpatient (Mark et al). These well-conducted studies show that restrictive opioid prescribing policies achieve the goal of reducing excess opioid exposure without causing undue harm, inconvenience or dissatisfaction among patients.\n\nThe objective of this study is to determine if a restrictive opioid prescription protocol (in which patients are not prescribed postoperative opioids unless they request them) is acceptable to patients after ambulatory and major urogynecologic surgery, compared to standard opioid prescribing practices. The study investigators believe that physicians can capitalize on the new ability to electronically prescribe opioids for patients who require them, to prevent over-prescribing without impacting patient care. The study also intends to describe postoperative opioid use patterns in the urogynecologic population, including factors predictive of opioid use and non-use. The results of this research will have a significant and timely impact by helping to reduce opioid overprescribing and informing future prescribing guidelines in the field of urogynecology.",
    "detailed_description": "Specific Aims\n\nAim 1. To compare patient satisfaction and pain control using two different opioid prescribing protocols.\n\nThe study investigators hypothesize that postoperative pain control and satisfaction will be non-inferior between patients not routinely prescribed opioids after surgery and those prescribed a standard quantity. Participants will be asked to rate their pain control during the first 7 postoperative days with validated questionnaires. Participants' satisfaction with pain control will be evaluated at their postoperative visit.\n\nAim 2. To examine opioid use patterns after ambulatory and major urogynecologic surgery.\n\nThe study investigators hypothesize that most postoperative patients will use few or no opioids after urogynecologic surgery, regardless of prescribing protocol. All participants will receive thorough counseling with detailed instructions on non-opioid pain management, as well as multimodal analgesia via ERAS protocol during the perioperative period. Participants will be asked to log their opioid and non-opioid medication use in the first postoperative week. The investigators will also assess the number of requests for opioid prescription (in those randomized to the restrictive protocol) and opioid refills (from patients in the standard protocol).\n\nAim 3. To determine patient and perioperative factors associated with opioid use after urogynecologic surgery.\n\nThe study investigators plan to collect and analyze demographic, clinical and psychometric data on all participants with the goal of predicting analgesic needs and opioid use after urogynecologic surgery. Results from this study will guide surgeons on how to tailor opioid prescriptions to the needs of each patient, based off individual patient and perioperative characteristics.",

Does TAP block enhance postoperative recovery and facilitate early mobilization? Does TAP block reduce the length of hospital stay? Does TAP block improve overall patient satisfaction following hysterectomy? If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare patients receiving TAP block with lidocaine and ropivacaine (0.2%, 0.4 ml/kg per side) to patients receiving standard analgesia without TAP block to see if the TAP block provides superior pain relief, lowers opioid needs, and improves recovery outcomes.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nUndergo elective total or subtotal hysterectomy. Receive either a TAP block (intervention group) or standard analgesic management (control group).\n\nHave their intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, pain scores, recovery parameters, and satisfaction assessed.",
    "detailed_description": "Hysterectomy is a common gynecological surgical procedure involving the removal of the uterus. The procedure may be total or subtotal, and is frequently associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain. Effective management of this pain is crucial and is typically achieved through multimodal analgesia. This approach includes regional nerve blocks, systemic analgesics (oral and intravenous), and adjunctive therapies (physical or psychological), resulting in reduced opioid requirements, minimized side effects, and shorter hospital stays.\n\nThe transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anesthesia technique involving the injection of a local anesthetic between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. This targets the thoracolumbar nerves (T6-L1) and provides effective analgesia for the anterior abdominal wall. When performed under ultrasound guidance following abdominal surgery, the TAP block has demonstrated benefits including decreased incisional pain, reduced opioid consumption, and improved postoperative mobilization.\n\nThis is a prospective, randomized, comparative clinical trial conducted within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mure\u0219 County Emergency Clinical Hospital. The study period extends from January 2024 to December 2025 or until the target sample size is reached. All anesthetic and surgical interventions utilized are within standard clinical practice; no experimental drugs or procedures are employed.\n\nThe study compares two multimodal analgesia protocols to identify the most effective and satisfactory method of postoperative pain management. All participants will provide written informed consent prior to enrollment.\n\nParticipants will be randomly allocated into two groups using a computer-generated randomization application on the day of surgery. The anesthesiologist performing the TAP block will be the only staff member aware of group allocation.\n\nTo maintain blinding, all participants will leave the operating room with bilateral lateral abdominal dressings, regardless of group assignment. Postoperative evaluators will be blinded to group allocation.\n\nThe transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block will be performed under ultrasound guidance using a Sonosite ultrasound system equipped with a linear probe (6-15 MHz). The block will be executed after induction of general anesthesia, utilizing the lateral approach.\n\nThe procedure begins by positioning the ultrasound probe at the level of the umbilicus, oriented transversely to identify the rectus abdominis muscle. The probe is then moved laterally and slightly posteriorly to visualize the three muscle layers of the lateral abdominal wall in cross-section: External oblique, Internal oblique, Transversus abdominis.\n\nThe final probe position will be between the iliac crest and the costal margin, where the muscle layers are clearly visualized. Under direct ultrasound visualization, the needle (Stimuplex Ultra 360, 20G \u00d7 6, 30\u00b0 bevel, 100-150 mm) is inserted in-plane, from medial to lateral, puncturing the skin above the probe and advancing through the tissue under the ultrasound beam.\n\nThe needle is advanced until it reaches the fascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Correct placement is confirmed by the appearance of the \"unzipping\" or hydro-dissection effect upon injection of a small volume of local anesthetic, indicating separation of the fascial layers.\n\nThe local anesthetic solution is then injected in increments of 5 ml per side, with aspiration performed after each increment to exclude intravascular needle placement.\n\nThe entire TAP block procedure is conducted under strict aseptic conditions, including:\n\n* Skin disinfection with Braunol iodine solution\n* Use of sterile gloves\n* Use of a sterile ultrasound probe cover\n* Sterile handling of all equipment and medications Preoperative data collected will include age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), ASA score, comorbidities, gynecologic diagnosis, and baseline Quality of Recovery score (QoR-15).\n\nIntraoperative data will include: time of anesthesia induction, time of TAP block (if applicable), time of surgical incision, total surgery duration, opioid consumption, heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nIntraoperative pain will be defined as a \u226520% increase in heart rate and/or blood pressure compared to baseline values recorded one day prior to surgery.\n\nPostoperative assessments will include:\n\n* Pain intensity at 0, 1, 4, 6, and 24 hours (at rest and during movement)\n* Numeric Rating Scale (0-10)\n* Patient satisfaction score at 24 hours\n* QoR-15 score at 48 hours Data will be recorded using standardized intraoperative and postoperative forms. The intraoperative form will be completed by the anesthesiologist performing the surgery. The postoperative form will be completed by a blinded evaluator (resident or specialist from another unit). All data will be entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using GraphPad Prism.\n\nResults will be statistically analyzed and interpreted to identify differences in pain control, opioid consumption, recovery, and patient satisfaction between the two groups. Conclusions will guide the development of updated institutional pain management protocols for hysterectomy.",

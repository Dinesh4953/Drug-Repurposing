We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between 16 PFAS compounds and five thyroid hormones (TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4) in the serum of a pregnant women, adolescents, and adults. The dose-response relationship between some PFAS and thyroid hormones in different population subpopulation was found and the model was fitted. We also amalgamated data from 18 animal experiments with previously published in vitro studies to elucidate the toxicological mechanisms underlying the impact of PFAS on the thyroid gland. The results of the study showed that (a) both conventional and emerging PFAS compounds were identified in human samples and exhibited associations with thyroid health outcomes; (b) in animal studies, PFAS have been found to impact thyroid gland health through two primary mechanisms: by influencing the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and by binding to thyroid receptors. This study provides a systematic description of the health effects and risk assessment associated with PFAS exposure on the thyroid gland. Furthermore, dose-response relationships were established through the Hill model in python."

Each technique operates uniquely on the thrombus, leading to differences in their efficacy. Factors including clot size, clot stiffness, vessel tortuosity, and the angle of interaction between the aspiration catheter and the clot significantly influence these differences. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown the overall equivalency of these techniques for the treatments of large vessel occlusion and distal medium vessel occlusions. However, there are nuanced differences that emerge under specific clinical circumstances, highlighting the absence of a one-size-fits-all strategy in acute ischemic stroke management. We emphasize the need for future investigations to elucidate these nuances further, aiming to refine procedural strategies and individualize patient care for optimal outcomes."

The revolution of single-cell genomics technologies offers an unprecedented opportunity to uncover how cells communicate in vivo within their tissue niches and how disruption of these niches can lead to diseases and developmental abnormalities. CellPhoneDB is a bioinformatics toolkit designed to infer cell-cell communication by combining a curated repository of bona fide ligand-receptor interactions with methods to integrate these interactions with single-cell genomics data. Here we present a protocol for the latest version of CellPhoneDB (v5), offering several new features. First, the repository has been expanded by one-third with the addition of new interactions, including ~1,000 interactions mediated by nonpeptidic ligands such as steroidogenic hormones, neurotransmitters and small G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-binding ligands. Second, we outline a new way of using the database that allows users to tailor queries to their experimental designs. Third, the update incorporates novel strategies to prioritize specific cell-cell interactions, leveraging information from other modalities such as tissue microenvironments derived from spatial transcriptomics technologies or transcription factor activities derived from a single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin assays. Finally, we describe the new CellPhoneDBViz module to interactively visualize and share results. Altogether, CellPhoneDB v5 enhances the precision of cell-cell communication inference, offering new insights into tissue biology in physiological microenvironments. This protocol typically takes ~15 min and requires basic knowledge of python."

    "abstract": "Since their discovery in 2014, reptile nidoviruses (also known as serpentoviruses) have emerged as significant pathogens worldwide. They are known for causing severe and often fatal respiratory disease in various captive snake species, especially pythons. Related viruses have been detected in other reptiles with and without respiratory disease, including captive and wild populations of lizards, and wild populations of freshwater turtles. There are many opportunities to better understand the viral diversity, species susceptibility, and clinical presentation in different species in this relatively new field of research. In captive snake collections, reptile nidoviruses can spread quickly and be associated with high morbidity and mortality, yet the potential disease risk to wild reptile populations remains largely unknown, despite reptile species declining on a global scale. Experimental studies or investigations of disease outbreaks in wild reptile populations are scarce, leaving the available literature limited mostly to exploring findings of naturally infected animals in captivity. Further studies into the pathogenesis of different reptile nidoviruses in a variety of reptile species is required to explore the complexity of disease and routes of transmission. This review focuses on the biology of these viruses, hosts and geographic distribution, clinical signs and pathology, laboratory diagnosis and management of reptile nidovirus infections to better understand nidovirus infections in reptiles."

In recent times, some of these oils have regained popularity due to their availability and affordability coupled with concerns about the side effects of commercially processed skin care products. This is to assess the chemical properties, current knowledge, source of procurement, indications for topical use, benefits, and possible adverse effects of six plant oils and one animal fat commonly used in Nigeria. This is a literature review and interview with traditional healers and alternative health practitioners to document the traditional, medical, cosmetics, and other usage of oils for skin and scalp care in the African context. Literature review was done on the biochemical and pharmacological properties of each of the seven oils. Searches were made from PubMed, African Journal online, Medline, and Google scholar. Medical subject heading terms used in the search include shea butter, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, soy oil, Baobab oil, and python oil. Plant and seed oils used locally in Nigeria and other African countries for skin care and treatment have several benefits due to the constituents of the plant oils (free fatty acids, triglycerides, ceramides, phospholipids, vitamins and antioxidants) which have been shown to promote healthy skin barrier function, wound healing and have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. They are however not without adverse effects, which may be mainly due to processing and storage hygiene. Further studies are required on these oils in view of their potential in the development of novel skincare products and dermatological therapies."

Reptiles originated more than 300\u00a0million years ago and they often dwell in polluted environments which may expose them to pathogenic micro-organisms, radiation and/or heavy metals. Reptiles also possess greater longevity and may live much longer than similar-sized land mammals, for example, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles and tuatara are long-lived reptiles living up to 100\u00a0years or more. Many recent studies have emphasized the pivotal role of the gut microbiome on its host; thus, we postulated that reptilian gut microbiome and/or its metabolites and the interplay with their robust immune system may contribute to their longevity and overall hardiness. Herein, we discuss the composition of the reptilian gut microbiome, immune system-gut microbiome cross-talk, antimicrobial peptides, reptilian resistance to infectious diseases and cancer, ageing, as well the current knowledge of the genome and epigenome of these remarkable species. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that microbial gut flora of reptiles such as crocodiles, tortoises, water monitor lizard and python exhibit remarkable anticancer and antibacterial properties, as well as comprise novel gut bacterial metabolites and antimicrobial peptides. The underlying mechanisms between the gut microbiome and the immune system may hold clues to developing new therapies overall for health, and possible extrapolation to exploit the ancient defence systems of reptiles for Homo sapiens benefit."

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2 . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis."

Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly scalable and powerful computational systems. Among the state-of-the-art parallel computing platforms, Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose, in-memory, iterative computing framework for large-scale data processing that ensures high fault tolerance and high scalability by introducing the resilient distributed dataset abstraction. In terms of performance, Spark can be up to 100 times faster in terms of memory access and 10 times faster in terms of disk access than Hadoop. Moreover, it provides advanced application programming interfaces in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It also supports some advanced components, including Spark SQL for structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for computing graphs, and Spark Streaming for stream computing. We surveyed Spark-based applications used in next-generation sequencing and other biological domains, such as epigenetics, phylogeny, and drug discovery. The results of this survey are used to provide a comprehensive guideline allowing bioinformatics researchers to apply Spark in their own fields."

Calcium, vitamin D3, and ultraviolet B (UVB) lighting recommendations vary in effectiveness amongst different species and can change with age. Phenotype-selective color patterns for spider ball pythons and scalation pattern for bearded dragons have resulted in vestibular disease, and increased evaporative water loss, respectively.

    "abstract": "New reconstruction techniques are generating connectomes of unprecedented size. These must be analyzed to generate human comprehensible results. The analyses being used fall into three general categories. The first is interactive tools used during reconstruction, to help guide the effort, look for possible errors, identify potential cell classes, and answer other preliminary questions. The second type of analysis is support for formal documents such as papers and theses. Scientific norms here require that the data be archived and accessible, and the analysis reproducible. In contrast to some other \"omic\" fields such as genomics, where a few specific analyses dominate usage, connectomics is rapidly evolving and the analyses used are often specific to the connectome being analyzed. These analyses are typically performed in a variety of conventional programming language, such as Matlab, R, Python, or C++, and read the connectomic data either from a file or through database queries, neither of which are standardized. In the short term we see no alternative to the use of specific analyses, so the best that can be done is to publish the analysis code, and the interface by which it reads connectomic data. A similar situation exists for archiving connectome data. Each group independently makes their data available, but there is no standardized format and long-term accessibility is neither enforced nor funded. In the long term, as connectomics becomes more common, a natural evolution would be a central facility for storing and querying connectomic data, playing a role similar to the National Center for Biotechnology Information for genomes. The final form of analysis is the import of connectome data into downstream tools such as neural simulation or machine learning. In this process, there are two main problems that need to be addressed. First, the reconstructed circuits contain huge amounts of detail, which must be intelligently reduced to a form the downstream tools can use. Second, much of the data needed for these downstream operations must be obtained by other methods (such as genetic or optical) and must be merged with the extracted connectome."

Unlike similar methods that rely on short sequencing reads, Nano-DMS-MaP employs nanopore sequencing to resolve the structures of long and highly similar RNA molecules to reveal their previously hidden structural differences. This Protocol describes the development and applications of Nano-DMS-MaP and outlines the main considerations for designing and implementing a successful experiment: from bench to data analysis. In cell probing experiments can be carried out by an experienced molecular biologist in 3-4 d.

    "abstract": "Identified genetic variants from genome wide association studies frequently show only modest effects on the disease risk, leading to the \"missing heritability\" problem. An avenue, to account for a part of this \"missingness\" is to evaluate gene-gene interactions (epistasis) thereby elucidating their effect on complex diseases. This can potentially help with identifying gene functions, pathways, and drug targets. However, the exhaustive evaluation of all possible genetic interactions among millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) raises several issues, otherwise known as the \"curse of dimensionality\". The dimensionality involved in the epistatic analysis of such exponentially growing SNPs diminishes the usefulness of traditional, parametric statistical methods. With the immense popularity of multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), a non-parametric method, proposed in 2001, that classifies multi-dimensional genotypes into one- dimensional binary approaches, led to the emergence of a fast-growing collection of methods that were based on the MDR approach. Moreover, machine-learning (ML) methods such as random forests and neural networks (NNs), deep-learning (DL) approaches, and hybrid approaches have also been applied profusely, in the recent years, to tackle this dimensionality issue associated with whole genome gene-gene interaction studies. However, exhaustive searching in MDR based approaches or variable selection in ML methods, still pose the risk of missing out on relevant SNPs. Furthermore, interpretability issues are a major hindrance for DL methods. To minimize this loss of information, Python based tools such as PySpark can potentially take advantage of distributed computing resources in the cloud, to bring back smaller subsets of data for further local analysis. Parallel computing can be a powerful resource that stands to fight this \"curse\". PySpark supports all standard Python libraries and C extensions thus making it convenient to write codes to deliver dramatic improvements in processing speed for extraordinarily large sets of data."

    "abstract": "Food-borne diseases are a global public health issue with 1 in 10 people falling ill after eating contaminated food every year. In response, the food industry has implemented several new pathogen control strategies, such as biotechnological tools using the direct application of bacteriophages for biological control. We have undertaken a systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated the efficiency of patented phages as a biological control for food-borne pathogens and determined the physical-chemical characteristics of the antimicrobial effect. Included and excluded criteria was developed. Included criteria: Phage patent files with an application in biological control on food and scientific articles and book chapters that used phages patented for food biological control. Excluded criteria: Patent documents, scientific articles, and book chapters that included phage therapy in humans, animals, and biological control on plants but did not have an application on food were not considered in our study. The systematic analysis identified 77 documents, 46 scientific articles, and 31 documents of patents and 23 articles was included in the meta-analysis. Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella sp. comprised most of the targets identified in the screening, so that we focused on these strains to do the meta-analysis. There are a total of 383 and 192 experiments for Listeria and Salmonella phages for quantitative data analysis.Indexing databases for the bibliographic search (Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) and PubMed (Medline) were addressed by an automated script written in Python 3 Python Core Team (2015) and deposited on GitHub ( https://github.com/glenjasper ).A random-effects meta-analysis revealed (i) significant antimicrobial effect of Listeria phages in apple, apple juice, pear, and pear juice, (ii) significant antimicrobial effect of Salmonella phages in eggs, apple, and ready-to-eat chicken, (iii) no heterogeneity was identified in either meta-analysis, (iv) publication bias was detected for Listeria phages but not for Salmonella phages. (v) ListShield and Felix01 phages showed the best result for Listeria and Salmonella biological control, respectively, (vi) concentration of phage and bacteria, time and food had significant effect in the biological control of Listeria, (vii) temperature and time had a significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of Salmonella phages. The systematic review and meta-analyses to determine the efficiency of bacteriophages previously patented against pathogenic bacteria on dairy products, meat, fruits and vegetables. Besides, the discovering of key factors for efficacy, so that future applications of phage biotechnology in foods can be optimally deployed."

    "abstract": "Enzyme reactions are highly dependent on reaction conditions. To ensure reproducibility of enzyme reaction parameters, experiments need to be carefully designed and kinetic modeling meticulously executed. Furthermore, to enable quality control of enzyme reaction parameters, the experimental conditions, the modeling process as well as the raw data need to be reported comprehensively. By taking these steps, enzyme reaction parameters can be open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable) as well as repeatable, replicable and reproducible. This review discusses these requirements and provides a practical guide to designing initial rate experiments for the determination of enzyme reaction parameters and gives an open, FAIR and re-editable example of the kinetic modeling of an enzyme reaction. Both the guide and example are scripted with Python in Jupyter Notebooks and are publicly available (https://fairdomhub.org/investigations/483/snapshots/1). Finally, the prerequisites of automated data analysis and machine learning algorithms are briefly discussed to provide further motivation for the comprehensive, open and FAIR reporting of enzyme reaction parameters."

The kallisto, bustools and kb-python programs are free, open-source software tools for performing this analysis that together can produce gene expression quantification from raw sequencing reads. The quantifications can be individualized for multiple cells, multiple samples or both. Additionally, these tools allow gene expression values to be classified as originating from nascent RNA species or mature RNA species, making this workflow amenable to both cell-based and nucleus-based assays. This protocol describes in detail how to use kallisto and bustools in conjunction with a wrapper, kb-python, to preprocess RNA-seq data. Execution of this protocol requires basic familiarity with a command line environment. With this protocol, quantification of a moderately sized RNA-seq dataset can be completed within minutes."

Requirements for performance in the complex biological environment lead to difficult a priori rational design choices and time-consuming empirical trial-and-error experimentation. Modern data science practices, especially artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML), offer the promise to help accelerate the identification and testing of next-generation biomaterials. However, it can be a daunting task for biomaterial scientists unfamiliar with modern ML techniques to begin incorporating these useful tools into their development pipeline. This Perspective lays the foundation for a basic understanding of ML while providing a step-by-step guide to new users on how to begin implementing these techniques. A tutorial Python script has been developed walking users through the application of an ML pipeline using data from a real biomaterial design challenge based on group's research.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cannot provide spatial information, while spatial transcriptomics technologies allow gene expression information to be obtained from intact tissue sections in the original physiological context at a spatial resolution. Various biological insights can be generated into tissue architecture and further the elucidation of the interaction between cells and the microenvironment. Thus, we can gain a general understanding of histogenesis processes and disease pathogenesis, etc. Furthermore, in silico methods involving the widely distributed R and Python packages for data analysis play essential roles in deriving indispensable bioinformation and eliminating technological limitations.

We used these technologies to define recent, current and future topics in pancreatic cancer research. Publications indexed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term 'Pancreatic Neoplasms' from January 1996 to October 2021 were downloaded from PubMed. Using the statistical computing language R and the interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language Python, we extracted publication dates, geographic information, and abstracts from each publication's metadata for bibliometric analyses. The generative statistical algorithm \"latent Dirichlet allocation\" (LDA) was applied to identify specific research topics and trends. The unsupervised \"Louvain algorithm\" was used to establish a network to identify relationships between single topics. A total of 60,296 publications were identified and analyzed. The publications were derived from 133 countries, mostly from the Northern Hemisphere. For the term \"pancreatic cancer research\", 12,058 MeSH terms appeared 1,395,060 times. Among them, we identified the four main topics \"Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis\", \"Review and Management\", \"Treatment Studies\", and \"Basic Research\". The number of publications has increased rapidly during the past 25 years. Based on the number of publications, the algorithm predicted that \"Immunotherapy\", Prognostic research\", \"Protein expression\", \"Case reports\", \"Gemcitabine and mechanism\", \"Clinical study of gemcitabine\", \"Operation and postoperation\", \"Chemotherapy and resection\", and \"Review and management\" as current research topics. To our knowledge, this is the first study on this subject of pancreatic cancer research, which has become possible due to the improvement of algorithms and hardware."

    "abstract": "The influence of metabolism on signaling, epigenetic markers, and transcription is highly complex yet important for understanding cancer physiology. Despite the development of high-resolution multi-omics technologies, it is difficult to infer metabolic activity from these indirect measurements. Fortunately, genome-scale metabolic models and constraint-based modeling provide a systems biology framework to investigate the metabolic states and define the genotype-phenotype associations by integrations of multi-omics data. Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are used to build and simulate metabolic networks using mathematical representations of biochemical reactions, gene-protein reaction associations, and physiological and biochemical constraints. These methods have led to advancements in metabolic reconstruction, network analysis, perturbation studies as well as prediction of metabolic state. Most computational tools for performing these analyses are written for MATLAB, a proprietary software. In order to increase accessibility and handle more complex datasets and models, community efforts have started to develop similar open-source tools in Python. To date there is a comprehensive set of tools in Python to perform various flux analyses and visualizations; however, there are still missing algorithms in some key areas. This review summarizes the availability of Python software for several components of COBRA methods and their applications in cancer metabolism. These tools are evolving rapidly and should offer a readily accessible, versatile way to model the intricacies of cancer metabolism for identifying cancer-specific metabolic features that constitute potential drug targets."

    "abstract": "Several studies applying Machine Learning to deception detection have been published in the last decade. A rich and complex set of settings, approaches, theories, and results is now available. Therefore, one may find it difficult to identify trends, successful paths, gaps, and opportunities for contribution. The present literature review aims to provide the state of research regarding deception detection with Machine Learning. We followed the PRISMA protocol and retrieved 648 articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science. 540 of them were screened (108 were duplicates). A final corpus of 81 documents has been summarized as mind maps. Metadata was extracted and has been encoded as Python dictionaries to support a statistical analysis scripted in Python programming language, and available as a collection of Jupyter Lab Notebooks in a GitHub repository. All are available as Jupyter Lab Notebooks. Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Tree and K-nearest Neighbor are the five most explored techniques. The studies report a detection performance ranging from 51% to 100%, with 19 works reaching accuracy rate above 0.9. Monomodal, Bimodal, and Multimodal approaches were exploited and achieved various accuracy levels for detection. Bimodal and Multimodal approaches have become a trend over Monomodal ones, although there are high-performance examples of the latter. Studies that exploit language and linguistic features, 75% are dedicated to English. The findings include observations of the following: language and culture, emotional features, psychological traits, cognitive load, facial cues, complexity, performance, and Machine Learning topics. We also present a dataset benchmark. Main conclusions are that labeled datasets from real-life data are scarce. Also, there is still room for new approaches for deception detection with Machine Learning, especially if focused on languages and cultures other than English-based. Further research would greatly contribute by providing new labeled and multimodal datasets for deception detection, both for English and other languages."

Acute exercise testing is used, often in combination with genetic, pharmacological, or other manipulations, to study the impact of these manipulations on the cardiovascular response to exercise and to detect impairments or improvements in cardiovascular function that may not be evident at rest. Chronic exercise conditioning models are used to study the cardiac phenotypic response to regular exercise training and as a platform for discovery of novel pathways mediating cardiovascular benefits conferred by exercise conditioning that could be exploited therapeutically. The cardiovascular benefits of exercise are well established, and, frequently, molecular manipulations that mimic the pathway changes induced by exercise recapitulate at least some of its benefits. This review discusses approaches for assessing cardiovascular function during an acute exercise challenge in rodents, as well as practical and conceptual considerations in the use of common rodent exercise conditioning models. The case for studying feeding in the Burmese python as a model for exercise-like physiological adaptation is also explored."

In this systematic review, we summarized longitudinal studies on recovery from post-stroke aphasia that used continuous or event-related temporal imaging (EEG or MEG). Methods We searched PubMed and Scopus for English articles published from 1950 to May 31, 2022. Results 34 studies were included in this review: 11 were non-interventional studies and 23 were clinical trials that used specific rehabilitation methods, neuromodulation, or drugs. The results of the non-interventional studies suggested that poor language recovery was associated with slow-wave activity persisting over time. The results of some clinical trials indicated that behavioral improvements were correlated with significant modulation of the N400 component. Discussion Compared with continuous EEG, ERP/EMF may more reliably identify biomarkers of therapy-induced effects. Electrophysiology should be used more often to explore language processes that are impaired after a stroke, as it may highlight treatment challenges for patients with post-stroke aphasia."

However, algorithmic and computational bottlenecks in analyzing heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets have prevented the full realization of this potential. CryoDRGN is a machine learning system for heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction of proteins and protein complexes from single-particle cryo-EM data. Central to this approach is a deep generative model for heterogeneous cryo-EM density maps, which we empirically find is effective in modeling both discrete and continuous forms of structural variability. Once trained, cryoDRGN is capable of generating an arbitrary number of 3D density maps, and thus interpreting the resulting ensemble is a challenge. Here, we showcase interactive and automated processing approaches for analyzing cryoDRGN results. Specifically, we detail a step-by-step protocol for the analysis of an existing assembling 50S ribosome dataset, including preparation of inputs, network training and visualization of the resulting ensemble of density maps. Additionally, we describe and implement methods to comprehensively analyze and interpret the distribution of volumes with the assistance of an associated atomic model. This protocol is appropriate for structural biologists familiar with processing single-particle cryo-EM datasets and with moderate experience navigating Python and Jupyter notebooks. It requires 3-4 days to complete. CryoDRGN is open source software that is freely available."

The PsmPy package debuted and proposed here is based on a logistic regression logit score where a match is selected using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Additional plotting and arguments are available to the user and are also described. To benchmark our method, we compared it with the existing R package, MatchIt, and evaluated our covariates' residual effect sizes with respect to the treatment condition before and after matching. Using a Mann-Whitney statistical test, we showed that our method significantly outperformed MatchIt in cohort matching (U=49, p<0.0001) when comparing residual effect sizes of the covariates. The PsmPy demonstrated a 10-fold average improvement in residual effect sizes amongst covariates when compared with the package MatchIt, suggesting that it is a viable alternative for use in propensity matching studies."

Data from included studies were analyzed using CiteSpace, Python, and Excel. Our study examined 897 articles from 65 countries and identified a significant exponential growth in annual publications. The USA and China were prominent contributors to this field, with high publication rates and funding agencies. Shanghai Jiao Tong University emerged as the most influential institution. The journals Analytical Chemistry and Analyst were found to be the most productive. Our keyword analysis revealed an intense interest for \"gold nanoparticle\" and \"pathology,\" with the most recent bursts occurring for \"surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS),\" \"biomarkers,\" and \"prostate specific antigen.\" As a detection tool, Raman spectroscopy holds the potential to assist in the identification, management, and prognostication of urological tumors. Notably, adjuvant diagnosis and prognosis evaluation based on SERS of tumor markers is a hot research topic. These findings offer valuable insights into the current state of Raman spectroscopy research in urological oncology, which could inform future studies and clinical practice."

    "abstract": "EnzymeML is an XML-based data exchange format that supports the comprehensive documentation of enzymatic data by describing reaction conditions, time courses of substrate and product concentrations, the kinetic model, and the estimated kinetic constants. EnzymeML is based on the Systems Biology Markup Language, which was extended by implementing the STRENDA Guidelines. An EnzymeML document serves as a container to transfer data between experimental platforms, modeling tools, and databases. EnzymeML supports the scientific community by introducing a standardized data exchange format to make enzymatic data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable according to the FAIR data principles. An application programming interface in Python supports the integration of software tools for data acquisition, data analysis, and publication. The feasibility of a seamless data flow using EnzymeML is demonstrated by creating an EnzymeML document from a structured spreadsheet or from a STRENDA DB database entry, by kinetic modeling using the modeling platform COPASI, and by uploading to the enzymatic reaction kinetics database SABIO-RK."

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals that heart chamber activation and repolarization are much faster in mammals and birds compared to ectothermic vertebrates of similar size. Temperature, however, affects electrophysiology of the heart and most data from ectotherms are determined at body temperatures lower than those of mammals and birds. The present manuscript is a review of the effects of temperature on intervals in the ECG of ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates rather than a hypothesis-testing original research article. However, the conclusions are supported by the inclusion of original data (Iguana iguana, N\u202f=\u202f4; Python regius, N\u202f=\u202f5; Alligator mississippiensis, N\u202f=\u202f4). Most comparisons were of animals of approximately 1\u202fkg. Compared to mammals and birds, the reptiles at 35-37\u202f\u00b0C had 4 fold lower heart rates, 2 fold slower atrial and ventricular conduction (longer P- and QRS-wave durations), and 4 fold longer PR intervals (atrioventricular delay) and QT intervals (total ventricular repolarization). We conclude that the faster chamber activation in endotherms cannot be explained by temperature alone. Based on histology, we show that endotherms have a more compact myocardial architecture. In mammals, disorganization of the compact wall by fibrosis associates with conduction slowing and we suggest the compact tissue architecture allows for faster chamber activation. The short cardiac cycle that characterizes mammals and birds, however, is predominantly accommodated by shortening of the atrioventricular delay and the QT interval, which is so long in a 1\u202fkg iguana that it compares to that of an elephant."

    "abstract": "The brain is an extraordinarily complex system that facilitates the optimal integration of information from different regions to execute its functions. With the recent advances in technology, researchers can now collect enormous amounts of data from the brain using neuroimaging at different scales and from numerous modalities. With that comes the need for sophisticated tools for analysis. The field of network neuroscience has been trying to tackle these challenges, and graph theory has been one of its essential branches through the investigation of brain networks. Recently, topological data analysis has gained more attention as an alternative framework by providing a set of metrics that go beyond pairwise connections and offer improved robustness against noise. In this hands-on tutorial, our goal is to provide the computational tools to explore neuroimaging data using these frameworks and to facilitate their accessibility, data visualisation, and comprehension for newcomers to the field. We will start by giving a concise (and by no means complete) overview of the field to introduce the two frameworks and then explain how to compute both well-established and newer metrics on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We use an open-source language (Python) and provide an accompanying publicly available Jupyter Notebook that uses the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset. Moreover, we would like to highlight one part of our notebook dedicated to the realistic visualisation of high order interactions in brain networks. This pipeline provides three-dimensional (3-D) plots of pairwise and higher-order interactions projected in a brain atlas, a new feature tailor-made for network neuroscience."

In the past, research was primarily conducted with a focus on hypothesis confirmation using sample data. However, in the era of big data, this has shifted to gaining insights from the collected data. Visualizing vast amounts of data to derive insights is crucial. For instance, leveraging big data for visualization can help identify and predict characteristics and patterns related to various infectious diseases. When data are presented in a visual format, patterns within the data become clear, making it easier to comprehend and provide deeper insights. This study aimed to comprehensively discuss data visualization and the various techniques used in the process. It also sought to enable researchers to directly use Python programs for data visualization. By providing practical visualization exercises on GitHub, this study aimed to facilitate their application in research endeavors."

We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between 16 PFAS compounds and five thyroid hormones (TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4) in the serum of a pregnant women, adolescents, and adults. The dose-response relationship between some PFAS and thyroid hormones in different population subpopulation was found and the model was fitted. We also amalgamated data from 18 animal experiments with previously published in vitro studies to elucidate the toxicological mechanisms underlying the impact of PFAS on the thyroid gland. The results of the study showed that (a) both conventional and emerging PFAS compounds were identified in human samples and exhibited associations with thyroid health outcomes; (b) in animal studies, PFAS have been found to impact thyroid gland health through two primary mechanisms: by influencing the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and by binding to thyroid receptors. This study provides a systematic description of the health effects and risk assessment associated with PFAS exposure on the thyroid gland. Furthermore, dose-response relationships were established through the Hill model in python."

Each technique operates uniquely on the thrombus, leading to differences in their efficacy. Factors including clot size, clot stiffness, vessel tortuosity, and the angle of interaction between the aspiration catheter and the clot significantly influence these differences. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown the overall equivalency of these techniques for the treatments of large vessel occlusion and distal medium vessel occlusions. However, there are nuanced differences that emerge under specific clinical circumstances, highlighting the absence of a one-size-fits-all strategy in acute ischemic stroke management. We emphasize the need for future investigations to elucidate these nuances further, aiming to refine procedural strategies and individualize patient care for optimal outcomes."

The revolution of single-cell genomics technologies offers an unprecedented opportunity to uncover how cells communicate in vivo within their tissue niches and how disruption of these niches can lead to diseases and developmental abnormalities. CellPhoneDB is a bioinformatics toolkit designed to infer cell-cell communication by combining a curated repository of bona fide ligand-receptor interactions with methods to integrate these interactions with single-cell genomics data. Here we present a protocol for the latest version of CellPhoneDB (v5), offering several new features. First, the repository has been expanded by one-third with the addition of new interactions, including ~1,000 interactions mediated by nonpeptidic ligands such as steroidogenic hormones, neurotransmitters and small G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-binding ligands. Second, we outline a new way of using the database that allows users to tailor queries to their experimental designs. Third, the update incorporates novel strategies to prioritize specific cell-cell interactions, leveraging information from other modalities such as tissue microenvironments derived from spatial transcriptomics technologies or transcription factor activities derived from a single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin assays. Finally, we describe the new CellPhoneDBViz module to interactively visualize and share results. Altogether, CellPhoneDB v5 enhances the precision of cell-cell communication inference, offering new insights into tissue biology in physiological microenvironments. This protocol typically takes ~15 min and requires basic knowledge of python."

      "abstract": "Since their discovery in 2014, reptile nidoviruses (also known as serpentoviruses) have emerged as significant pathogens worldwide. They are known for causing severe and often fatal respiratory disease in various captive snake species, especially pythons. Related viruses have been detected in other reptiles with and without respiratory disease, including captive and wild populations of lizards, and wild populations of freshwater turtles. There are many opportunities to better understand the viral diversity, species susceptibility, and clinical presentation in different species in this relatively new field of research. In captive snake collections, reptile nidoviruses can spread quickly and be associated with high morbidity and mortality, yet the potential disease risk to wild reptile populations remains largely unknown, despite reptile species declining on a global scale. Experimental studies or investigations of disease outbreaks in wild reptile populations are scarce, leaving the available literature limited mostly to exploring findings of naturally infected animals in captivity. Further studies into the pathogenesis of different reptile nidoviruses in a variety of reptile species is required to explore the complexity of disease and routes of transmission. This review focuses on the biology of these viruses, hosts and geographic distribution, clinical signs and pathology, laboratory diagnosis and management of reptile nidovirus infections to better understand nidovirus infections in reptiles."

In recent times, some of these oils have regained popularity due to their availability and affordability coupled with concerns about the side effects of commercially processed skin care products. This is to assess the chemical properties, current knowledge, source of procurement, indications for topical use, benefits, and possible adverse effects of six plant oils and one animal fat commonly used in Nigeria. This is a literature review and interview with traditional healers and alternative health practitioners to document the traditional, medical, cosmetics, and other usage of oils for skin and scalp care in the African context. Literature review was done on the biochemical and pharmacological properties of each of the seven oils. Searches were made from PubMed, African Journal online, Medline, and Google scholar. Medical subject heading terms used in the search include shea butter, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, soy oil, Baobab oil, and python oil. Plant and seed oils used locally in Nigeria and other African countries for skin care and treatment have several benefits due to the constituents of the plant oils (free fatty acids, triglycerides, ceramides, phospholipids, vitamins and antioxidants) which have been shown to promote healthy skin barrier function, wound healing and have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. They are however not without adverse effects, which may be mainly due to processing and storage hygiene. Further studies are required on these oils in view of their potential in the development of novel skincare products and dermatological therapies."

      "abstract": "Reptiles are ectothermic amniotes in a world dominated by endotherms. Reptiles originated more than 300\u00a0million years ago and they often dwell in polluted environments which may expose them to pathogenic micro-organisms, radiation and/or heavy metals. Reptiles also possess greater longevity and may live much longer than similar-sized land mammals, for example, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles and tuatara are long-lived reptiles living up to 100\u00a0years or more. Many recent studies have emphasized the pivotal role of the gut microbiome on its host; thus, we postulated that reptilian gut microbiome and/or its metabolites and the interplay with their robust immune system may contribute to their longevity and overall hardiness. Herein, we discuss the composition of the reptilian gut microbiome, immune system-gut microbiome cross-talk, antimicrobial peptides, reptilian resistance to infectious diseases and cancer, ageing, as well the current knowledge of the genome and epigenome of these remarkable species. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that microbial gut flora of reptiles such as crocodiles, tortoises, water monitor lizard and python exhibit remarkable anticancer and antibacterial properties, as well as comprise novel gut bacterial metabolites and antimicrobial peptides. The underlying mechanisms between the gut microbiome and the immune system may hold clues to developing new therapies overall for health, and possible extrapolation to exploit the ancient defence systems of reptiles for Homo sapiens benefit."

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2 . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis."

Based on those deposited in GitHub repositories, the most popular employed Python libraries are identified. We hope that this survey will serve as a resource to learn about machine learning or specific architectures thereof by identifying accessible codes with accompanying papers on a topic basis. To this end, we also include computational chemistry open-source software for generating training data and fundamental Python libraries for machine learning.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly scalable and powerful computational systems. Among the state-of-the-art parallel computing platforms, Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose, in-memory, iterative computing framework for large-scale data processing that ensures high fault tolerance and high scalability by introducing the resilient distributed dataset abstraction. In terms of performance, Spark can be up to 100 times faster in terms of memory access and 10 times faster in terms of disk access than Hadoop. Moreover, it provides advanced application programming interfaces in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It also supports some advanced components, including Spark SQL for structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for computing graphs, and Spark Streaming for stream computing. We surveyed Spark-based applications used in next-generation sequencing and other biological domains, such as epigenetics, phylogeny, and drug discovery. The results of this survey are used to provide a comprehensive guideline allowing bioinformatics researchers to apply Spark in their own fields."

      "abstract": "New reconstruction techniques are generating connectomes of unprecedented size. These must be analyzed to generate human comprehensible results. The analyses being used fall into three general categories. The first is interactive tools used during reconstruction, to help guide the effort, look for possible errors, identify potential cell classes, and answer other preliminary questions. The second type of analysis is support for formal documents such as papers and theses. Scientific norms here require that the data be archived and accessible, and the analysis reproducible. In contrast to some other \"omic\" fields such as genomics, where a few specific analyses dominate usage, connectomics is rapidly evolving and the analyses used are often specific to the connectome being analyzed. These analyses are typically performed in a variety of conventional programming language, such as Matlab, R, Python, or C++, and read the connectomic data either from a file or through database queries, neither of which are standardized. In the short term we see no alternative to the use of specific analyses, so the best that can be done is to publish the analysis code, and the interface by which it reads connectomic data. A similar situation exists for archiving connectome data. Each group independently makes their data available, but there is no standardized format and long-term accessibility is neither enforced nor funded. In the long term, as connectomics becomes more common, a natural evolution would be a central facility for storing and querying connectomic data, playing a role similar to the National Center for Biotechnology Information for genomes. The final form of analysis is the import of connectome data into downstream tools such as neural simulation or machine learning. In this process, there are two main problems that need to be addressed. First, the reconstructed circuits contain huge amounts of detail, which must be intelligently reduced to a form the downstream tools can use. Second, much of the data needed for these downstream operations must be obtained by other methods (such as genetic or optical) and must be merged with the extracted connectome."

      "abstract": "Identified genetic variants from genome wide association studies frequently show only modest effects on the disease risk, leading to the \"missing heritability\" problem. An avenue, to account for a part of this \"missingness\" is to evaluate gene-gene interactions (epistasis) thereby elucidating their effect on complex diseases. This can potentially help with identifying gene functions, pathways, and drug targets. However, the exhaustive evaluation of all possible genetic interactions among millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) raises several issues, otherwise known as the \"curse of dimensionality\". The dimensionality involved in the epistatic analysis of such exponentially growing SNPs diminishes the usefulness of traditional, parametric statistical methods. With the immense popularity of multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), a non-parametric method, proposed in 2001, that classifies multi-dimensional genotypes into one- dimensional binary approaches, led to the emergence of a fast-growing collection of methods that were based on the MDR approach. Moreover, machine-learning (ML) methods such as random forests and neural networks (NNs), deep-learning (DL) approaches, and hybrid approaches have also been applied profusely, in the recent years, to tackle this dimensionality issue associated with whole genome gene-gene interaction studies. However, exhaustive searching in MDR based approaches or variable selection in ML methods, still pose the risk of missing out on relevant SNPs. Furthermore, interpretability issues are a major hindrance for DL methods. To minimize this loss of information, Python based tools such as PySpark can potentially take advantage of distributed computing resources in the cloud, to bring back smaller subsets of data for further local analysis. Parallel computing can be a powerful resource that stands to fight this \"curse\". PySpark supports all standard Python libraries and C extensions thus making it convenient to write codes to deliver dramatic improvements in processing speed for extraordinarily large sets of data."

In response, the food industry has implemented several new pathogen control strategies, such as biotechnological tools using the direct application of bacteriophages for biological control. We have undertaken a systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated the efficiency of patented phages as a biological control for food-borne pathogens and determined the physical-chemical characteristics of the antimicrobial effect. Included and excluded criteria was developed. Included criteria: Phage patent files with an application in biological control on food and scientific articles and book chapters that used phages patented for food biological control. Excluded criteria: Patent documents, scientific articles, and book chapters that included phage therapy in humans, animals, and biological control on plants but did not have an application on food were not considered in our study. The systematic analysis identified 77 documents, 46 scientific articles, and 31 documents of patents and 23 articles was included in the meta-analysis. Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella sp. comprised most of the targets identified in the screening, so that we focused on these strains to do the meta-analysis.

To ensure reproducibility of enzyme reaction parameters, experiments need to be carefully designed and kinetic modeling meticulously executed. Furthermore, to enable quality control of enzyme reaction parameters, the experimental conditions, the modeling process as well as the raw data need to be reported comprehensively. By taking these steps, enzyme reaction parameters can be open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable) as well as repeatable, replicable and reproducible. This review discusses these requirements and provides a practical guide to designing initial rate experiments for the determination of enzyme reaction parameters and gives an open, FAIR and re-editable example of the kinetic modeling of an enzyme reaction. Both the guide and example are scripted with Python in Jupyter Notebooks and are publicly available (https://fairdomhub.org/investigations/483/snapshots/1). Finally, the prerequisites of automated data analysis and machine learning algorithms are briefly discussed to provide further motivation for the comprehensive, open and FAIR reporting of enzyme reaction parameters."

Using the statistical computing language R and the interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language Python, we extracted publication dates, geographic information, and abstracts from each publication's metadata for bibliometric analyses. The generative statistical algorithm \"latent Dirichlet allocation\" (LDA) was applied to identify specific research topics and trends. The unsupervised \"Louvain algorithm\" was used to establish a network to identify relationships between single topics. A total of 60,296 publications were identified and analyzed. The publications were derived from 133 countries, mostly from the Northern Hemisphere. For the term \"pancreatic cancer research\", 12,058 MeSH terms appeared 1,395,060 times. Among them, we identified the four main topics \"Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis\", \"Review and Management\", \"Treatment Studies\", and \"Basic Research\". The number of publications has increased rapidly during the past 25 years. Based on the number of publications, the algorithm predicted that \"Immunotherapy\", Prognostic research\", \"Protein expression\", \"Case reports\", \"Gemcitabine and mechanism\", \"Clinical study of gemcitabine\", \"Operation and postoperation\", \"Chemotherapy and resection\", and \"Review and management\" as current research topics. To our knowledge, this is the first study on this subject of pancreatic cancer research, which has become possible due to the improvement of algorithms and hardware."

      "abstract": "The influence of metabolism on signaling, epigenetic markers, and transcription is highly complex yet important for understanding cancer physiology. Despite the development of high-resolution multi-omics technologies, it is difficult to infer metabolic activity from these indirect measurements. Fortunately, genome-scale metabolic models and constraint-based modeling provide a systems biology framework to investigate the metabolic states and define the genotype-phenotype associations by integrations of multi-omics data. Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are used to build and simulate metabolic networks using mathematical representations of biochemical reactions, gene-protein reaction associations, and physiological and biochemical constraints. These methods have led to advancements in metabolic reconstruction, network analysis, perturbation studies as well as prediction of metabolic state. Most computational tools for performing these analyses are written for MATLAB, a proprietary software. In order to increase accessibility and handle more complex datasets and models, community efforts have started to develop similar open-source tools in Python. To date there is a comprehensive set of tools in Python to perform various flux analyses and visualizations; however, there are still missing algorithms in some key areas. This review summarizes the availability of Python software for several components of COBRA methods and their applications in cancer metabolism. These tools are evolving rapidly and should offer a readily accessible, versatile way to model the intricacies of cancer metabolism for identifying cancer-specific metabolic features that constitute potential drug targets."

A rich and complex set of settings, approaches, theories, and results is now available. Therefore, one may find it difficult to identify trends, successful paths, gaps, and opportunities for contribution. The present literature review aims to provide the state of research regarding deception detection with Machine Learning. We followed the PRISMA protocol and retrieved 648 articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science. 540 of them were screened (108 were duplicates). A final corpus of 81 documents has been summarized as mind maps. Metadata was extracted and has been encoded as Python dictionaries to support a statistical analysis scripted in Python programming language, and available as a collection of Jupyter Lab Notebooks in a GitHub repository. All are available as Jupyter Lab Notebooks. Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Tree and K-nearest Neighbor are the five most explored techniques. The studies report a detection performance ranging from 51% to 100%, with 19 works reaching accuracy rate above 0.9. Monomodal, Bimodal, and Multimodal approaches were exploited and achieved various accuracy levels for detection. Bimodal and Multimodal approaches have become a trend over Monomodal ones, although there are high-performance examples of the latter. Studies that exploit language and linguistic features, 75% are dedicated to English. The findings include observations of the following: language and culture, emotional features, psychological traits, cognitive load, facial cues, complexity, performance, and Machine Learning topics. We also present a dataset benchmark. Main conclusions are that labeled datasets from real-life data are scarce. Also, there is still room for new approaches for deception detection with Machine Learning, especially if focused on languages and cultures other than English-based. Further research would greatly contribute by providing new labeled and multimodal datasets for deception detection, both for English and other languages."

Acute exercise testing is used, often in combination with genetic, pharmacological, or other manipulations, to study the impact of these manipulations on the cardiovascular response to exercise and to detect impairments or improvements in cardiovascular function that may not be evident at rest. Chronic exercise conditioning models are used to study the cardiac phenotypic response to regular exercise training and as a platform for discovery of novel pathways mediating cardiovascular benefits conferred by exercise conditioning that could be exploited therapeutically. The cardiovascular benefits of exercise are well established, and, frequently, molecular manipulations that mimic the pathway changes induced by exercise recapitulate at least some of its benefits. This review discusses approaches for assessing cardiovascular function during an acute exercise challenge in rodents, as well as practical and conceptual considerations in the use of common rodent exercise conditioning models. The case for studying feeding in the Burmese python as a model for exercise-like physiological adaptation is also explored."

In this systematic review, we summarized longitudinal studies on recovery from post-stroke aphasia that used continuous or event-related temporal imaging (EEG or MEG). Methods We searched PubMed and Scopus for English articles published from 1950 to May 31, 2022. Results 34 studies were included in this review: 11 were non-interventional studies and 23 were clinical trials that used specific rehabilitation methods, neuromodulation, or drugs. The results of the non-interventional studies suggested that poor language recovery was associated with slow-wave activity persisting over time. The results of some clinical trials indicated that behavioral improvements were correlated with significant modulation of the N400 component. Discussion Compared with continuous EEG, ERP/EMF may more reliably identify biomarkers of therapy-induced effects. Electrophysiology should be used more often to explore language processes that are impaired after a stroke, as it may highlight treatment challenges for patients with post-stroke aphasia."

      "abstract": "Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful technique to visualize the structural landscape sampled by a protein complex. However, algorithmic and computational bottlenecks in analyzing heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets have prevented the full realization of this potential. CryoDRGN is a machine learning system for heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction of proteins and protein complexes from single-particle cryo-EM data. Central to this approach is a deep generative model for heterogeneous cryo-EM density maps, which we empirically find is effective in modeling both discrete and continuous forms of structural variability. Once trained, cryoDRGN is capable of generating an arbitrary number of 3D density maps, and thus interpreting the resulting ensemble is a challenge. Here, we showcase interactive and automated processing approaches for analyzing cryoDRGN results. Specifically, we detail a step-by-step protocol for the analysis of an existing assembling 50S ribosome dataset, including preparation of inputs, network training and visualization of the resulting ensemble of density maps. Additionally, we describe and implement methods to comprehensively analyze and interpret the distribution of volumes with the assistance of an associated atomic model. This protocol is appropriate for structural biologists familiar with processing single-particle cryo-EM datasets and with moderate experience navigating Python and Jupyter notebooks. It requires 3-4 days to complete. CryoDRGN is open source software that is freely available."

The process of selecting untreated cases that are the best match to the treated cases is the focus of this research. We created a PSM package for the python environment, termed PsmPy, to carry out this task. The PsmPy package debuted and proposed here is based on a logistic regression logit score where a match is selected using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Additional plotting and arguments are available to the user and are also described. To benchmark our method, we compared it with the existing R package, MatchIt, and evaluated our covariates' residual effect sizes with respect to the treatment condition before and after matching. Using a Mann-Whitney statistical test, we showed that our method significantly outperformed MatchIt in cohort matching (U=49, p<0.0001) when comparing residual effect sizes of the covariates. The PsmPy demonstrated a 10-fold average improvement in residual effect sizes amongst covariates when compared with the package MatchIt, suggesting that it is a viable alternative for use in propensity matching studies."

The present study retrieved literature on the utilization of Raman spectroscopy in urological oncology from the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection, spanning from its inception to June 2023. Data from included studies were analyzed using CiteSpace, Python, and Excel. Our study examined 897 articles from 65 countries and identified a significant exponential growth in annual publications. The USA and China were prominent contributors to this field, with high publication rates and funding agencies. Shanghai Jiao Tong University emerged as the most influential institution. The journals Analytical Chemistry and Analyst were found to be the most productive. Our keyword analysis revealed an intense interest for \"gold nanoparticle\" and \"pathology,\" with the most recent bursts occurring for \"surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS),\" \"biomarkers,\" and \"prostate specific antigen.\" As a detection tool, Raman spectroscopy holds the potential to assist in the identification, management, and prognostication of urological tumors. Notably, adjuvant diagnosis and prognosis evaluation based on SERS of tumor markers is a hot research topic. These findings offer valuable insights into the current state of Raman spectroscopy research in urological oncology, which could inform future studies and clinical practice."

Temperature, however, affects electrophysiology of the heart and most data from ectotherms are determined at body temperatures lower than those of mammals and birds. The present manuscript is a review of the effects of temperature on intervals in the ECG of ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates rather than a hypothesis-testing original research article. However, the conclusions are supported by the inclusion of original data (Iguana iguana, N\u202f=\u202f4; Python regius, N\u202f=\u202f5; Alligator mississippiensis, N\u202f=\u202f4). Most comparisons were of animals of approximately 1\u202fkg. Compared to mammals and birds, the reptiles at 35-37\u202f\u00b0C had 4 fold lower heart rates, 2 fold slower atrial and ventricular conduction (longer P- and QRS-wave durations), and 4 fold longer PR intervals (atrioventricular delay) and QT intervals (total ventricular repolarization). We conclude that the faster chamber activation in endotherms cannot be explained by temperature alone. Based on histology, we show that endotherms have a more compact myocardial architecture. In mammals, disorganization of the compact wall by fibrosis associates with conduction slowing and we suggest the compact tissue architecture allows for faster chamber activation. The short cardiac cycle that characterizes mammals and birds, however, is predominantly accommodated by shortening of the atrioventricular delay and the QT interval, which is so long in a 1\u202fkg iguana that it compares to that of an elephant."

With the recent advances in technology, researchers can now collect enormous amounts of data from the brain using neuroimaging at different scales and from numerous modalities. With that comes the need for sophisticated tools for analysis. The field of network neuroscience has been trying to tackle these challenges, and graph theory has been one of its essential branches through the investigation of brain networks. Recently, topological data analysis has gained more attention as an alternative framework by providing a set of metrics that go beyond pairwise connections and offer improved robustness against noise. In this hands-on tutorial, our goal is to provide the computational tools to explore neuroimaging data using these frameworks and to facilitate their accessibility, data visualisation, and comprehension for newcomers to the field. We will start by giving a concise (and by no means complete) overview of the field to introduce the two frameworks and then explain how to compute both well-established and newer metrics on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We use an open-source language (Python) and provide an accompanying publicly available Jupyter Notebook that uses the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset. Moreover, we would like to highlight one part of our notebook dedicated to the realistic visualisation of high order interactions in brain networks. This pipeline provides three-dimensional (3-D) plots of pairwise and higher-order interactions projected in a brain atlas, a new feature tailor-made for network neuroscience."

These antibodies can be difficult to detect as they do not cause any symptoms but can lead to kidney damage. A new blood test will be performed alongside existing antibody tests to see how well the test functions in comparison and to see how well it is able to distinguish between inflammation caused by antibodies and other sorts of inflammation such as a urinary tract infection. The investigators also want to determine whether it is predictable whom will develop antibodies after a transplant and use these results to change the current way patients are monitored for antibodies after receiving a transplant. In addition to this, the investigators want to establish if patients over 60 years of age are relatively protected against immunological events such as rejection compared to patients who are under 60 years of age. The results could potentially lead to using a different immunosuppression regime based on which population age group patients belong to and lowering the risks associated with these drugs.",
      "detailed_description": "Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA)\n\nPost-transplant monitoring for acute rejection in most centres, focuses on identification of a deterioration in graft function which may be totally asymptomatic. The current best practice to investigate a suspected rejection are renal graft biopsy with appropriate staining for complement component C4d and a serum single antigen bead (SAB) testing. This reactive approach to assessing and monitoring rejection, mainly driven by serial assessments of renal function to determine response to treatment, avoids the need for multiple invasive diagnostic tests such as biopsies, but it poses the risk of missing the early detection and treatment of rejection prior to an objective decline in function. A \"creeping creatinine\", where there are small but sustained increases in creatinine at sequential visits is relatively common and by the time a deterioration consistent with rejection is observed there can already have been significant tissue damage.\n\nDonor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) has been described as a useful biomarker for graft injury secondary to rejection which can be evident in blood weeks to months prior to histological evidence of graft injury. dd-cfDNA levels are high in the immediate post-operative phase, although there is a sharp drop off to low baseline levels after a few days to two weeks making it a useful biomarker in all but the earliest rejection episode. Levels are much higher in antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) when compared to cellular rejection offering improvements in sensitivity when considering ABMR alone (85%) versus rejection of all aetiology (59%). The investigators believe it is important to correlate the findings of the dd-cfDNA sample with the other tests described, so that observations about the percentage dd-cfDNA found in different pathologies and the overall frequency of positive results can be made.\n\nImmunological Factors in Older Age Renal Transplant and Longitudinal Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA) study\n\nOlder patients who undergo kidney transplant (KT) have better survival than those who remain on the waiting list. Nevertheless, outcomes are inferior to younger recipients and KT is often felt to be a predominantly quality of life intervention for older patients. Frailty may have a beneficial influence on the risk of post-transplant adverse immunological events and rejection episodes. If transplanted with good quality organs (all barring elderly deceased after circulatory death - DCD grafts), older kidney transplant recipients will have fewer rejection episodes than younger counterparts. The investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of the outcomes for older age transplant recipients (\\>60) locally, to compare results before and after the change in allocation system which coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the investigators observed less favourable HLA-mismatching, a higher rate of re-intervention (operative or interventional radiology), higher rates of tertiary centre readmissions and higher 1-year mortality rates.\n\nThe previous post-transplant HLA-specific antibody work examined only the first positive sample post-transplant independent of pre-transplant sensitisation status. The investigators, thus, propose prospectively recruiting patients, irrespective of age, undergoing transplant to determine the overall frequency of immunological events and de novo HLA specific antibody formation. Given the importance of early detection and intervention of antibody mediated processes and optimising treatment protocols for frail patients, the investigators aim to expand the research interest in post-transplant antibody monitoring. The investigators, thus, propose prospectively recruiting patients, irrespective of age, undergoing transplant to determine the overall frequency of immunological events and de novo HLA specific antibody formation. Data on clinical outcomes will be collected and the investigators would look to compare the \\<60s with those 60 or older patients undergoing kidney transplant.\n\nDetermining Predictive Models for Post-transplant HLA-specific Antibody Formation\n\nAs an adjunct to the proposed study looking at the influence of age on immunological events, the investigators aim to examine the cohort as a whole to determine the differential clinical outcomes for patients with and without de novo HLA-specific antibody over time. An important part of this arm of the study will be to determine predictive models using machine learning methodology to determine those most at risk for the development of de-novo HLA specific antibody post-transplant.",

Behavioral outcomes related to mental health will be assessed at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Multimodal biomarkers (functional and structural MRI, electrodermal activity, and heart rate) will be collected pre- and post-intervention. The primary objective is to establish feasibility, defined by rates of retention and adherence, fidelity, feasibility, acceptability, and burden. Secondary outcomes include recruitment and randomization rates. This trial will provide essential data to inform the design of future large-scale clinical studies of IML for post-stroke mental health recovery.",

The potential of photo-based artificial intelligence algorithms to predict and minimize the difficulties encountered during intubation is the main motivation for this study.\n\nThe utilization of artificial intelligence algorithms within the domain of airway management holds considerable promise in providing real-time feedback to anesthesiologists, enhancing the efficacy of intubation procedures, and reducing the occurrence of complications. Specifically, photo-based AI systems can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of airway anatomy by analyzing images captured prior to and during intubation, thereby enhancing the management of complex cases.The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy and reliability of photo-based artificial intelligence algorithms in evaluating the complexity of intubation with a double lumen tube.The integration of artificial intelligence into the intubation process is intended to enhance patient outcomes and establish a new benchmark for anesthesia practice. This study aims to address the existing gap in the literature and provide innovative approaches to clinical practice.\n\nInformed consent was obtained from patients undergoing thoracic surgery operations, and demographic data (age, height, body weight, body mass index, gender), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, type of operation, and comorbid diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea) were obtained. Thoracic and/or extrath oracic malignancy history), parameters considered as risk factors for difficult intubation (history of previous difficult intubation, LEMON criteria (look externally, evaluate, mallampathy, obstruction, neck mobility), upper lip bite test) and photographs of the patients (including head and neck region) will be recorded in six different directions and ways with a professional camera (actively used in our hospital) in the preoperative period. During the intraoperative phase, the Cormack-Lehane scoring system will be employed, and the intubation process with a double-lumen tube will be evaluated for ease or difficulty. Intraoperative complications related to the operation will also be documented.The data will then be processed using Python 3 programming language and open-source libraries to calculate artificial intelligence algorithms. In the event of incomplete patient data, data imputation techniques will be employed to supplement the artificial intelligence program.\n\nThe primary outcome variable of the study is the rate at which the photo-based artificial intelligence algorithm predicts whether intubation with a double lumen tube is easy or difficult.The secondary outcome variable is the comparison of the rate of prediction of intubation with double lumen tube by photo-based artificial intelligence algorithms and the rate of prediction of intubation with double lumen tube by conventional methods.",

      "brief_summary": "Introduction Throughout human history, surgical interventions have been frequently used in human treatment. However, despite their therapeutic properties, the pain experienced by patients, especially in the acute postoperative period, can be quite challenging for clinicians. Acute postoperative pain is an important public health issue. While 80% of patients report experiencing pain in the postoperative period, 88% of them experience moderate or higher levels of pain. According to another study, more than 60% of surgical patients suffer from moderate to severe acute postoperative pain, and this pain has been associated with the development of chronic postoperative pain. Poorly managed postoperative pain can lead to negative outcomes such as lower patient satisfaction, delayed patient recovery, increased length of hospital stay, increased care costs, chronic pain, unnecessary opioid prescription, opioid abuse, overdose, and death. In addition, in order to provide effective pain management, the method of providing preventive analgesic treatment before the pain begins is frequently used. However, this situation may lead to unnecessary medication administration in many patients and consequently, many adverse events such as bleeding, respiratory depression, cardiac events or gastrointestinal system side effects of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics. As a result, the difficulty in predicting acute postoperative pain leads to suboptimal pain management. Therefore, being able to predict which patients will suffer from moderate to severe acute postoperative pain will optimize the risk-benefit ratio of perioperative analgesic treatments and ensure that appropriate treatment is given. Although different studies on this subject have tried to predict postoperative pain with logistic regression analysis, the desired result has not yet been achieved. This situation becomes even more important in surgeries with a high risk of severe pain in the postoperative period, such as lung resection. In order to reduce or prevent postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing lung resection, it is very important for patients to be able to cough without feeling pain and thus to remove secretions from the respiratory tract. If sufficient analgesia is not provided, these patients cannot perform this effectively. This increases complications, hospital stay, and patient care costs. In order to prevent these negative situations and provide optimal analgesia, new methods are needed to predict postoperative pain levels. Numerous models have been proposed in studies to understand the risk factors that will exacerbate severe acute postoperative pain. Most of the research in this area has focused on determining risk factors for postoperative pain using statistical methodology. Previous studies suggest that machine learning models can outperform linear statistical models in classifying postoperative pain-related outcomes when similar features are considered. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are algorithms that can combine and analyze complex data with hundreds of variables and provide new outputs, and can guide an effective solution in predicting and managing the postoperative process. Previous studies have shown promising results in predicting acute postoperative pain with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 using artificial intelligence algorithms to predict pain with perioperative data. However, studies on this topic are needed in a specific surgery such as lung resection, which has the potential for severe pain.\n\nThis study aimed to predict postoperative pain by analyzing perioperative data using AI algorithms in lung resections and to determine the effectiveness of AI algorithms in this regard. Thus, it aimed to reduce unnecessary analgesic use in patients, eliminate possible side effects of these drugs, and start effective analgesic treatment in a timely manner in patients with high pain risk.\n\nPurpose/Hypothesis:\n\nThis study aimed to predict postoperative pain by analyzing perioperative data using AI algorithms in lung resections and to determine the effectiveness of AI algorithms in this regard.\n\nH0: Artificial intelligence algorithms are not effective in predicting postoperative pain in lung resections.\n\nH1: Artificial intelligence algorithms are effective in predicting postoperative pain in lung resections.\n\nMaterial-Method:\n\nThis study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and will be carried out at the SB\u00dc Ankara Atat\u00fcrk Sanatorium Training and Research Hospital after receiving ethics committee approval. Our study is a retro-prospective study. Retrospectively collected patient data will be evaluated prospectively with artificial intelligence algorithms.",

The investigators collected symptom data of 67 IBD patients who achieved and maintained clinical remissions after they had taken herbal medicine prescriptions. Prescriptions were categorised into 5 patterns, which were named after main features and symptoms of included patients. Associations between presenting symptoms and patterns were visualised using a term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method. Determining IBD patterns from symptoms of patients was analysed and charted by decision tree modeling.",

However, variability in pattern identification of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)/Traditional East Asian Medicine (TEAM) has been criticised. Using data of patients who achieved and maintained clinical remission after TCM/TEAM herbal medicine prescription, the investigators aimed to develop treatment algorithms refined by identified pattern and key symptoms which practitioners can easily discriminate.\n\nBased on herbal prescriptions which induced clinical remission, IBD patients were divided into 5 patterns, i.e., Large intestine type, Water-dampness type, Respiratory type, Upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract type, and Coldness type. By term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method, the association between 22 symptoms that were described as indications of the herbal medicine prescriptions and 5 patterns were analysed. Decision tree modeling was used for prediction of relevant patterns from symptoms.",

The goal of the body temperature alerting system is to use it during rest, exercise in the heat and during body cooling. Using this system during cooling will allow healthcare professionals and military personnel monitor core temperature to ensure cooling is effective (and prevent hypothermia). Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to validate a body temperature alerting system using physiological responses that occur during rest, exercise in the heat and during body cooling. Multiple cooling modalities will be validated. This study is expanding on a previous intervention IRB#H20-0010 (BHSAI Cooling Study), but will examine body cooling during more intense exercise and while cycling. We will also examine the effectiveness of each cooling modality (passive cooling, mist-fan cooling, hand/forearm immersion, ice towel) on physiological variables after exercise in the heat.",
      "detailed_description": "Design\n\nThe study will be completed in the following timeline:\n\nVisit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing\n\nVist 2: Metabolic Heat Production Visit\n\nVisit 3-6: Trial 1, 2 ,3, 4\n\nVisit specific information is described below, however, specific data collection protocols for dependent variables and procedures are included below the description of the study design. Participants will be asked to sign a photo/video release form (Appendix H) to be used in research projects, scientific publications/conferences and for educational purposes. Participants may be videoed or photographed while exercising or resting in the environmental chamber. Participants will be assigned after medical clearance is granted.\n\nVisit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing\n\nParticipants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for a baseline and VO2max testing day. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) will be measured upon arrival during the baseline visit. The participant will lay supine with a ventilated hood covering their head and torso. The ventilated hood will be attached to a hose connected to a metabolic cart. The metabolic cart will continuously measure respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen consumption, and substrate utilization. The participant will remain under the hood for approximately 30 minutes. Upon completion of BMR, participants will provide a urine sample in a clean urine cup. Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will also be recorded. Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by taking measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door, and the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted to continue to the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) \u22641.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. If USG is greater than 1.025 the subject will be rescheduled for a different day. Height will be measured with a tape measure on Visit 1. Percent body fat will be measured using Air displacement plethysmography (BodPod\u00ae; Cosmed, Software Version 4.2+, Concord, CA, USA). This will take less than \\~5 minutes to complete. This information will be used to describe the subject demographics. Participants will also be asked to complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test on a treadmill and on a cycle ergometer in a thermoneutral environment with about 30 minutes to one hour between. This test will provide aerobic fitness levels of the participants which will be compared between the two exercise protocols. Participants will also be asked about their average weekly physical activity (Appendix K). This visit will take approximately 1-2 hours.\n\nVisit 2: Metabolic Heat Production Visit\n\nIn order to prescribe appropriate exercise intensity, heat production must be controlled. Heat production will be prescribed utilizing a graded exercise test (3-5 minute stages) in the heat (same environmental temperature as trials) that will measure metabolic data via collection of expired air utilizing 2-way non-rebreathing mask in order to calculate heat production and appropriately choose cycling intensities to compare between groups of research participants. This test will occur following the baseline visit. The study procedures will mimic those of trials (described below), with the exception of the exercise protocol. The exercise protocol will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. It will include 5 stages of exercise (graded stages). The participant will wear the ACU during this visit.\n\nVisit 3-6: Trials 1-4\n\nParticipant numbers will be randomly assigned, and 4 trials (mist-fan, forearm, passive cooling, ice towel) will be ordered with a random number generator and assigned to a participant number.\n\nThese orders will be counterbalanced between participants to ensure that there is not an order effect. Each participant will complete four trials as part of the study. Participants will be allowed to make-up trial visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do not meet hydration requirements. Participants will be asked if they have a current illness or taking medications to determine whether they can complete the exercise trial. The participant's visit will be rescheduled if they have a fever, current illness or taking medications that influence body temperature. Participants will complete four trials on four separate days.\n\nTrial #\n\nCooling Intervention\n\n1\n\nPassive Cooling\n\n2\n\nMist-fan Cooling\n\n3\n\nForearm Immersion\n\n4\n\nIce Towel\n\nThe exercise protocol and recovery portions of this study will be conducted in a climatic chamber with ambient temperature approximately 30-40\u00b0C and relative humidity at approximately 30-70%. Participants will drink ad libitum throughout the exercise trial.\n\nUpon arrival to the lab, participants will be asked to indicate if they have consumed alcohol or caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours, respectively. They will not be asked to specify exactly what they have consumed, but if they provide a positive indication, their trial will be rescheduled for another day. Participants will provide a small urine sample in a clean urine cup, and a nude body mass will be measured. Upon arrival to the lab, hydration status will be assessed by urine specific gravity, nude body mass and urine color. Participants will only be permitted to continue to the exercise trial if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) \u22641.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. If USG is greater than 1.025 then the subject will be rescheduled for a different day. Participants will be given instructions at the prior visit about how to obtain desired hydration status for the upcoming trial. Researchers will insert an esophageal probe. Only trained personnel are permitted to insert the esophageal probe (no undergraduates will be allowed). Participants will insert a rectal probe and wear a heart rate monitor strap. Additionally, participants will wear 9-site Biopac skin temperature sensors. Researchers will apply the skin temperature sensors with medical tape to the participants' chest, upper arm, forearm, thigh, neck, abdomen, thigh, back, and calf (anterior and posterior). Participants will also wear iButtons (wireless skin temperature sensors) on their chest, upper arm, forearm, thigh, and calf (anterior and posterior). The participants will also be asked to complete a subjective sleep questionnaire upon arriving to the lab. Participants will wear an active combat uniform (ACU) during the exercise trials. Three ADU sizes for the blouse and pants (small, medium, large) will be available for the participants. A belt will be used to ensure the ACU fits appropriately. Participants will not be able to keep the ACU- ADUs will be washed (according to manufacturer's instructions) and re-used for participants. ADU manufacturer's instructions is identical to standard washing cycle (detergent and washing machine dry). The ACU will be weighed before and after use to measure sweat captured in the clothing. Participants will wear the wrist-based devices (provided by BHSAI) on their non-dominant arm throughout the testing. The wrist device must be placed approximately 1-inch proximal to the wrist and be fitted snugly for accurate heart-rate measurements. The wrist device is used to estimate heart rate using infrared technology. The wrist device estimates of heart rate will be compared to the polar heart rate monitor (gold standard). The body alerting system uses heart rate from the wrist device and the environmental conditions to estimate body temperature. The sponsor of the study will use rectal temperature and the 7-site skin temperature sensors to alter the algorithm (not in real time- from the collected data) to better estimate body temperature. The future goal is to have the body alerting system imbedded in the watch. Participants will wear another wrist-based device (WHOOP) on the arm that does not have the BHSAI device. The WHOOP device will monitor heart rate variability and sleep. Participants will be asked to wear this device daily for the duration of the study.\n\nParticipants will enter the environmental chamber and sit for 30 minutes to become equilibrated. The environmental chamber will be set to 30-40\u00b0C ambient temperature, 30-70% relative humidity After baseline measures of heart rate, rectal temperature, participants will complete the perceptual indices. Participants will also complete an environmental symptoms questionnaire (ESQ).\n\nThe trial will consist of two 40-minute intervals of cycling from 7W/kg to 15 W/kg. Each 40-minute exercise block will be followed by a rest break where cooling will occur. Participants will be allowed to drink ad libitum throughout the exercise trial. The participant will be cooled for approximately 30 minutes with their assigned cooling modality. Rectal and esophageal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, perceptual measures, and mood (POMS, described below) will be collected at various time points before, during, and after exercise and cooling. Metabolic heat production will be measured using indirect calorimetry (mask connected to metabolic cart) during all four trials.\n\nPassive Cooling: Participants will be asked to sit in a chair in the climate chamber for passive cooling.\n\nMist-fan cooling: A mist-fan will be placed next to the participant and will mist-fan only their hands and forearms during mist-fan cooling. Participants will be asked to roll up their ADU sleeves to increase skin surface area. The temperature of the mist and wind speed of the fan will be recorded.\n\nForearm immersion: The participant will place their forearm in approximately 20\u00b0C water during forearm immersion.\n\nIce Towel: a towel that can hold water for extended periods will be used and submerged in an ice-water mixture (\\~2 C). Researchers will gently squeeze the towel to remove excess water (but remain saturated with water) and then apply to both forearms and hands snuggly so that there is no air gap between the towel and the extremity. Apply for 1-5 minutes and then replace it with another fresh, cold towel. This step would ensure that the forearms and hands have near about constant application temperature as the towel would get warm over the application period. The process will be repeated for the entire cooling duration.\n\nData collection will be divided into two separate phases. A pilot study will be first conducted in which the first two participants will complete all study laboratory visits. Data from those trials will be shared with the sponsor for review before continuation of data collection. Participants will undergo the same procedures for the pilot testing as regular testing. Pilot testing data will be included in the dataset. Following approval from the sponsor, data collection will resume. Each trial will be approximately 4 hours.\n\nAll devices will be properly cleaned according to manufacturer's instruction prior to use by other participants.",

    "explanation": "Based on the provided data, the decision to repurpose the drug 'python' is conditional. The potential off-label benefit in new therapeutic areas, limited studies in pediatric population, and need for improved safety profile suggest that repurposing could be beneficial. Additionally, the market size and growth rate are promising, with a market size of 6.72B USD in 2024 and a CAGR of 4.8%. The moderate export performance and potential growth in emerging markets also support repurposing. However, the limited clinical trial data and patent count (8 trials and 6 patents) suggest that further research is needed before making a final decision. Therefore, the decision is conditional on further investigation and potential investment in research and development."

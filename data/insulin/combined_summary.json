      "abstract": "Insulin is the paramount anabolic hormone, promoting carbon energy deposition in the body. Its synthesis, quality control, delivery, and action are exquisitely regulated by highly orchestrated intracellular mechanisms in different organs or \"stations\" of its bodily journey. In this Beyond the Cell review, we focus on these five stages of the journey of insulin through the body and the captivating cell biology that underlies the interaction of insulin with each organ. We first analyze insulin's biosynthesis in and export from the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas. Next, we focus on its first pass and partial clearance in the liver with its temporality and periodicity linked to secretion. Continuing the journey, we briefly describe insulin's action on the blood vasculature and its still-debated mechanisms of exit from the capillary beds. Once in the parenchymal interstitium of muscle and adipose tissue, insulin promotes glucose uptake into myofibers and adipocytes, and we elaborate on the intricate signaling and vesicle traffic mechanisms that underlie this fundamental function. Finally, we touch upon the renal degradation of insulin to end its action. Cellular discernment of insulin's availability and action should prove critical to understanding its pivotal physiological functions and how their failure leads to diabetes."

This discovery and insulin's rapid clinical deployment effectively transformed type 1 diabetes from a fatal diagnosis into a medically manageable chronic condition. In this Review, we describe key accomplishments leading to and building on this momentous occasion in medical history, including advancements in our understanding of the role of insulin in diabetes pathophysiology, the molecular characterization of insulin and the clinical use of insulin. Achievements are also viewed through the lens of patients impacted by insulin therapy and the evolution of insulin pharmacokinetics and delivery over the past 100 years. Finally, we reflect on the future of insulin therapy and diabetes treatment, as well as challenges to be addressed moving forward, so that the full potential of this transformative discovery may be realized."

      "abstract": "Insulin is the master regulator of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism. Following ingestion of an oral glucose load or mixed meal, the plasma glucose concentration rises, insulin secretion by the beta cells is stimulated and the hyperinsulinemia, working in concert with hyperglycemia, causes: (i) suppression of endogenous (primarily reflects hepatic) glucose production, (ii) stimulation of glucose uptake by muscle, liver, and adipocytes, (iii) inhibition of lipolysis leading to a decline in plasma FFA concentration which contributes to the suppression of hepatic glucose production and augmentation of muscle glucose uptake, and (iv) vasodilation in muscle, which contributes to enhanced muscle glucose disposal. Herein, the integrated physiologic impact of insulin to maintain normal glucose homeostasis is reviewed and the molecular basis of insulin's diverse actions in muscle, liver, adipocytes, and vasculature are discussed."

      "abstract": "Basal insulin continues to be a vital part of therapy for many people with diabetes. First attempts to prolong the duration of insulin formulations were through the development of suspensions that required homogenization prior to injection. These insulins, which required once- or twice-daily injections, introduced wide variations in insulin exposure contributing to unpredictable effects on glycemia. Advances over the last 2 decades have resulted in long-acting, soluble basal insulin analogues with prolonged and less variable pharmacokinetic exposure, improving their efficacy and safety, notably by reducing nocturnal hypoglycemia. However, adherence and persistence with once-daily basal insulin treatment remains low for many reasons including hypoglycemia concerns and treatment burden. A soluble basal insulin with a longer and flatter exposure profile could reduce pharmacodynamic variability, potentially reducing hypoglycemia, have similar efficacy to once-daily basal insulins, simplify dosing regimens, and improve treatment adherence. Insulin icodec (Novo Nordisk) and insulin efsitora alfa (basal insulin Fc [BIF], Eli Lilly and Company) are 2 such insulins designed for once-weekly administration, which have the potential to provide a further advance in basal insulin replacement. Icodec and efsitora phase 2 clinical trials, as well as data from the phase 3 icodec program indicate that once-weekly insulins provide comparable glycemic control to once-daily analogues, with a similar risk of hypoglycemia. This manuscript details the technology used in the development of once-weekly basal insulins. It highlights the clinical rationale and potential benefits of these weekly insulins while also discussing the limitations and challenges these molecules could pose in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) is a major pathogenic factor in the progression of MASLD. In the liver, insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis and enhances de novo lipogenesis (DNL). During IR, there is a defect in insulin-mediated suppression of gluconeogenesis, but an unrestrained increase in hepatic lipogenesis persists. The mechanism of increased hepatic steatosis in IR is unclear and remains controversial. The key discrepancy is whether insulin retains its ability to directly regulate hepatic lipogenesis. Blocking insulin/IRS/AKT signaling reduces liver lipid deposition in IR, suggesting insulin can still regulate lipid metabolism; hepatic glucose metabolism that bypasses insulin's action may contribute to lipogenesis; and due to peripheral IR, other tissues are likely to impact liver lipid deposition. We here review the current understanding of insulin's action in governing different aspects of hepatic lipid metabolism under normal and IR states, with the purpose of highlighting the essential issues that remain unsettled."

      "abstract": "This consensus statement is a comprehensive update of the 2010 Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia (SAMBA) Consensus Statement on perioperative blood glucose management in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing ambulatory surgery. Since the original consensus guidelines in 2010, several novel therapeutic interventions have been introduced to treat DM, including new hypoglycemic agents and increasing prevalence of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors. The updated recommendations were developed by an expert task force under the provision of SAMBA and are based on a comprehensive review of the literature from 1980 to 2022. The task force included SAMBA members with expertise on this topic and those contributing to the primary literature regarding the management of DM in the perioperative period. The recommendations encompass preoperative evaluation of patients with DM presenting for ambulatory surgery, management of preoperative oral hypoglycemic agents and home insulins, intraoperative testing and treatment modalities, and blood glucose management in the postanesthesia care unit and transition to home after surgery. High-quality evidence pertaining to perioperative blood glucose management in patients with DM undergoing ambulatory surgery remains sparse. Recommendations are therefore based on recent guidelines and available literature, including general glucose management in patients with DM, data from inpatient surgical populations, drug pharmacology, and emerging treatment data. Areas in need of further research are also identified. Importantly, the benefits and risks of interventions and clinical practice information were considered to ensure that the recommendations maintain patient safety and are clinically valid and useful in the ambulatory setting. What Other Guidelines Are Available on This Topic? Since the publication of the SAMBA Consensus Statement for perioperative blood glucose management in the ambulatory setting in 2010, several recent guidelines have been issued by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the Endocrine Society, the Centre for Perioperative Care (CPOC), and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) on DM care in hospitalized patients; however, none are specific to ambulatory surgery. How Does This Guideline Differ From the Previous Guidelines? Previously posed clinical questions that were outdated were revised to reflect current clinical practice. Additional questions were developed relating to the perioperative management of patients with DM to include the newer therapeutic interventions."

      "abstract": "Insulin replacement therapy is indispensable in the treatment of type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. However, insulin's clinical application is challenging due to its narrow therapeutic index. To mitigate acute and chronic risks of glucose excursions, glucose-responsive insulin (GRI) has long been pursued for clinical application. By integrating GRI with glucose-sensitive elements, GRI is capable of releasing or activating insulin in response to plasma or interstitial glucose levels without external monitoring, thereby improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic risk. In this Perspective, we first introduce the history of GRI development and then review major glucose-responsive components that can be leveraged to control insulin delivery. Subsequently, we highlight the recent advances in GRI delivery carriers and insulin analogs. Finally, we provide a look to the future and the challenges of clinical application of GRI."

      "abstract": "Design of \"first-generation\" insulin analogues over the past 3 decades has provided pharmaceutical formulations with tailored pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties. Application of a molecular tool kit-integrating protein sequence, chemical modification, and formulation-has thus led to improved prandial and basal formulations for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Although PK/PD changes were modest in relation to prior formulations of human and animal insulins, significant clinical advantages in efficacy (mean glycemia) and safety (rates of hypoglycemia) were obtained. Continuing innovation is providing further improvements to achieve ultrarapid and ultrabasal analogue formulations in an effort to reduce glycemic variability and optimize time in range. Beyond such PK/PD metrics, next-generation insulin analogues seek to exploit therapeutic mechanisms: glucose-responsive (\"smart\") analogues, pathway-specific (\"biased\") analogues, and organ-targeted analogues. Smart insulin analogues and delivery systems promise to mitigate hypoglycemic risk, a critical barrier to glycemic control, whereas biased and organ-targeted insulin analogues may better recapitulate physiologic hormonal regulation. In each therapeutic class considerations of cost and stability will affect use and global distribution. This review highlights structural principles underlying next-generation design efforts, their respective biological rationale, and potential clinical applications."

Few published guidelines have been available to help such professionals and their patients manage these therapies. Herein, we present new, practical, and comprehensive recommendations for diabetes injections and infusions. These recommendations were informed by a large international survey of current practice and were written and vetted by 183 diabetes experts from 54 countries at the Forum for Injection Technique and Therapy: Expert Recommendations (FITTER) workshop held in Rome, Italy, in 2015. Recommendations are organized around the themes of anatomy, physiology, pathology, psychology, and technology. Key among the recommendations are that the shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and, therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them; effective long-term therapy with insulin is critically dependent on addressing psychological hurdles upstream, even before insulin has been started; inappropriate disposal of used sharps poses a risk of infection with blood-borne pathogens; and mitigation is possible with proper training, effective disposal strategies, and the use of safety devices. Adherence to these new recommendations should lead to more effective therapies, improved outcomes, and lower costs for patients with diabetes."

      "abstract": "2021 to 2022 marks the one hundredth anniversary of ground-breaking research in Toronto that changed the course of what was, then, a universally fatal disease: type 1 diabetes. Some would argue that insulin's discovery by Banting, Best, Macleod, and Collip was the greatest scientific advance of the 20th century, being one of the first instances in which modern medical science was able to provide lifesaving therapy. As with all scientific discoveries, the work in Toronto built upon important advances of many researchers over the preceding decades. Furthermore, the Toronto work ushered in a century of discovery of the purification, isolation, structural characterization, and genetic sequencing of insulin, all of which influenced ongoing improvements in therapeutic insulin formulations. Here we discuss the body of knowledge prior to 1921 localizing insulin to the pancreas and establishing insulin's role in glucoregulation, and provide our views as to why researchers in Toronto ultimately achieved the purification of pancreatic extracts as a therapy. We discuss the pharmaceutical industry's role in the early days of insulin production and distribution and provide insights into why the discoverers chose not to profit financially from the discovery. This fascinating story of bench-to-beside discovery provides useful considerations for scientists now and in the future."

This approach means that glucose sensing needs to be replaced and levels of insulin need to mimic physiological insulin-action profiles, including basal coverage and changes around meals. Training and educating patients are crucial for the achievement of good glycaemic control, but having insulin preparations with action profiles that provide stable basal insulin coverage and appropriate mealtime insulin peaks helps people with type 1 diabetes mellitus to live active lives without sacrificing tight glycaemic control. Insulin analogues enable patients to achieve this goal, as some have fast action profiles, and some have very slow action profiles, which gives people with type 1 diabetes mellitus the tools to achieve dynamic insulin-action profiles that enable tight glycaemic control with a risk of hypoglycaemia that is lower than that with human short-acting and long-acting insulins. This Review discusses the established and novel insulin analogues that are used to treat patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and provides insights into the future development of insulin analogues."

This review updates the information on new insulins, their mechanisms of action and the benefits they provide in the treatment of diabetes. Insulin analogues attempt to mimic the physiological secretion of the hormone, including time of action and duration of effect. The most used prandial analogs are the so-called rapid-acting insulins, including Faster Aspartic and the new basal insulins, glargine U300 and degludec, which have a prolonged action of more than 24 hours and therefore require a daily dose. New technologies under development include biosimilar insulins such as the glargine biosimilar, already available in the clinic. New formulations are being developed for the future, as well as novel ways of dispersing them, mimicking the action of pancreatic cells, which will allow a more physiological and personalized management of the disease."

Insulin's dominating control of glucose metabolism is orchestrated by complex and highly regulated signaling cascades that elicit diverse and unique effects on skeletal muscle. We discuss the discoveries that have led to our current understanding of how insulin promotes glucose uptake in muscle. We also touch upon insulin access to muscle, and insulin signaling toward glycogen, lipid, and protein metabolism. We draw from human and rodent studies in\u00a0vivo, isolated muscle preparations, and muscle cell cultures to home in on the molecular, biophysical, and structural elements mediating these responses. Finally, we offer some perspective on molecular defects that potentially underlie the failure of muscle to take up glucose efficiently during obesity and type 2 diabetes."

      "abstract": "Despite the availability of new classes of glucose-lowering drugs that improve glycaemic levels and minimise long-term complications, at least 20-25% of people with type 2 diabetes require insulin therapy. Moreover, a substantial proportion of these individuals do not achieve adequate metabolic control following insulin initiation. This is due to several factors: therapeutic inertia, fear of hypoglycaemia and/or weight gain, poor communication, complexity of insulin titration, and the number of injections needed, with the associated reduced adherence to insulin therapy. Once-weekly insulins provide a unique opportunity to simplify basal insulin therapy and to allow good glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Several approaches to developing a stable and effective once-weekly insulin have been proposed, but, to date, insulin icodec and basal insulin Fc (insulin efsitora alfa) are the only two formulations for which clinical studies have been reported. The results of Phase I and II studies emphasise both efficacy (in term of glucose levels) and potential risks and adverse events. Phase III studies involving insulin icodec are reassuring regarding the risk of hypoglycaemia compared with daily basal insulin analogues. Despite some concerns raised in ongoing clinical trials, the available data suggest that weekly insulins may also be an option for individuals with type 1 diabetes, especially when adherence is suboptimal. For the first time there is an opportunity to make an important breakthrough in basal insulin therapy, particularly in people with type 2 diabetes, and to improve not only the quality of life of people with diabetes, but also the practice of diabetologists."

For human insulin, the recommendations of current shelf life in use may range from 10 to 45 days, and the maximum temperature in use varies between 25 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. Optimal cold-chain management of human insulin from manufacturing until the point of delivery to people with diabetes should always be maintained, and people with diabetes and access to reliable refrigeration should follow manufacturers' recommendations. However, a growing segment of the diabetes-affected global population resides in challenging environments, confronting prolonged exposure to extreme heat due to the climate crisis, all while grappling with limited access to refrigeration."

      "abstract": "Insulin is an essential drug in the treatment of diabetes, often necessary for managing hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It should be considered in cases of severe hyperglycemia requiring hospitalization, after the failure of other treatments, in advanced chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, post-transplant diabetes, or during pregnancy. Moreover, in specific patient subgroups, early initiation of insulin is crucial for hyperglycemia control and prevention of chronic complications. Clinical guidelines recommend initiating insulin when other treatments fail, although there are barriers that may delay its initiation. The timing of initiation depends on individual patient characteristics. Typically, insulinization starts by adding basal insulin to the patient's existing treatment and, if necessary, progresses by gradually introducing prandial insulin. Several barriers have been identified that hinder the initiation of insulin, including fear of hypoglycemia, lack of adherence, the need for glucose monitoring, the injection method of insulin administration, social rejection associated with the stigma of injections, weight gain, a sense of therapeutic failure at initiation, lack of experience among some healthcare professionals, and the delayed and reactive positioning of insulin in recent clinical guidelines. These barriers contribute, among other factors, to therapeutic inertia in initiating and intensifying insulin treatment and to patients' non-adherence. In this context, the development of once-weekly insulin formulations could improve initial acceptance, adherence, treatment satisfaction, and consequently, the quality of life for patients. Currently, two once-weekly basal insulins, insulin icodec and basal insulin BIF, which are in different stages of clinical development, may help. Their longer half-life translates to lower variability and reduced risk of hypoglycemia. This review addresses the need for insulin in T2DM, its positioning in clinical guidelines under specific circumstances, the current barriers to initiating and intensifying insulin treatment, and the potential role of once-weekly insulin formulations as a potential solution to facilitate timely initiation of insulinization, which would reduce therapeutic inertia and achieve better early control in people with T2DM."

      "abstract": "Many patients with type 2 diabetes will ultimately require the inclusion of basal insulin in their treatment regimen. Since most people with type 2 diabetes are managed in the community, it is important that primary care providers understand and correctly manage the initiation and titration of basal insulins, and help patients to self-manage insulin injections. Newer, long-acting basal insulins provide greater stability and flexibility than older preparations and improved delivery systems. Basal insulin is usually initiated at a conservative dose of 10 units/day or 0.1-0.2 units/kg/day, then titrated thereafter over several weeks or months, based on patients' self-measured fasting plasma glucose, to achieve an individualized target (usually 80-130\u2009mg/dL). Through a shared decision-making process, confirmation of appropriate goals and titration methods should be established, including provisions for events that might alter scheduled titration (e.g. travel, dietary change, illness, hospitalization, etc.). Although switching between basal insulins is usually easily accomplished, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between formulations require clinicians to provide explicit guidance to patients. Basal insulin is effective long-term, but overbasalization (continuing to escalate dose without a meaningful reduction in fasting plasma glucose) should be avoided.Key messagesPrimary care providers often initiate basal insulin for people with type 2 diabetes.Basal insulin is recommended to be initiated at 10 units/day or 0.1-0.2 units/kg/day, and doses must be titrated to agreed fasting plasma glucose goals, usually 80-130\u2009mg/dL. A simple rule is to gradually increase the initial dose by 1 unit per day (NPH, insulin detemir, and glargine 100 units/mL) or 2-4 units once or twice per week (NPH, insulin detemir, glargine 100 and 300 units/mL, and degludec) until FPG levels remain consistently within the target range. If warranted, switching between basal insulins can be done using simple regimens.The dose of basal insulin should be increased as required up to approximately 0.5-1.0 units/kg/day in some cases. Overbasalization (continuing to escalate dose without a meaningful reduction in fasting plasma glucose) is not recommended; rather re-evaluation of individual therapy, including consideration of more concentrated basal insulin preparations and/or short-acting prandial insulin as well as other glucose-lowering therapies, is suggested."

A rapid bench-to-bedside application of the lifesaving pancreatic extract and its immediate commercialization was the result of a promising idea, positive drive, perseverance, and collaboration of Banting and colleagues. As one of the very few proteins isolated in a pure form at that time, insulin also played a key role in the development of important methodologies and in the beginning of various fields of modern science. Since its discovery, insulin has evolved continuously to optimize the care of people with diabetes. Since the 1980s, recombinant DNA technology has been employed to engineer insulin analogs by modifying their amino acid sequence, which has resulted in the production of insulins with various profiles that are currently used. However, unmet needs in insulin treatment still exist, and several forms of future insulins are under development. In this review, we discuss the past, present, and future of insulin, including a history of ceaseless innovations and collective intelligence. We believe that this story will be a solid foundation and an unerring guide for the future."

Little is known if and how brain insulin sensitivity can be restored in humans. We aimed to evaluate the effects of an exercise intervention on insulin sensitivity of the brain and how this relates to exercise-induced changes in whole-body metabolism and behavior.METHODSIn this clinical trial, sedentary participants who were overweight and obese underwent an 8-week supervised aerobic training intervention. Brain insulin sensitivity was assessed in 21 participants (14 women, 7 men; age range 21-59 years; BMI range 27.5-45.5 kg/m2) using functional MRI, combined with intranasal administration of insulin, before and after the intervention.RESULTSThe exercise program resulted in enhanced brain insulin action to the level of a person of healthy weight, demonstrated by increased insulin-induced striatal activity and strengthened hippocampal functional connectivity. Improved brain insulin action correlated with increased mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle, reductions in visceral fat and hunger, as well as improved cognition. Mediation analyses suggest that improved brain insulin responsiveness helps mediate the peripheral exercise effects leading to healthier body fat distribution and reduced perception of hunger.CONCLUSIONOur study demonstrates that an 8-week exercise intervention in sedentary individuals can restore insulin action in the brain. Hence, the ameliorating benefits of exercise toward brain insulin resistance may provide an objective therapeutic target in humans in the challenge to reduce diabetes risk factors.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03151590).FUNDINGBMBF/DZD 01GI0925."

After intake of the intervention meals, glucose and insulin followed the predicted pattern, but subjective hunger did not. At the group level, low glycemic index meals led to lower energy intake changes. At the individual level, energy intake changes were unrelated to body fatness or levels of glucose, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, free fatty acids, L-lactate, leptin, adrenaline, glucagon-like peptide-1, glucagon, and insulin-glucagon ratio.

However, many individuals with diabetes are either reluctant to initiate or are nonadherent to their insulin therapy for various reasons, including fear of frequent injections. Technosphere Insulin (TI) is a novel inhaled insulin powder that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the management of diabetes. The results from 2 phase III clinical trials have shown that TI was noninferior to subcutaneous insulin aspart and superior to inhaled placebo in lowering HbA1c in patients with diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2, respectively. Across both studies, TI appears to be generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being hypoglycemia and cough. However, long-term pulmonary safety concerns have not been addressed and additional studies are needed. Overall, TI appears to be a promising noninvasive prandial insulin alternative for individuals with diabetes who are at risk for medication nonadherence due to aversion to frequent injections.

      "abstract": "Insulin signalling begins with binding to its cell surface insulin receptor (IR), which is a tyrosine kinase. The insulin receptor kinase (IRK) is subsequently autophosphorylated and activated to tyrosine phosphorylate key cellular substrates that are essential for entraining the insulin response. Although IRK activation begins at the cell surface, it is maintained and augmented following internalization into the endosomal system (ENS). The peroxovanadium compounds (pVs) were discovered to activate the IRK in the absence of insulin and lead to a full insulin response. Thus, IRK activation is both necessary and sufficient for insulin signalling. Furthermore, this could be shown to occur with activation of only the endosomal IRK. The mechanism of pV action was shown to be the inhibition of IRK-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Our studies showed that the duration and intensity of insulin signalling are modulated within ENS by the recruitment of cellular substrates to ENS; intra-endosomal acidification, which promotes dissociation of insulin from the IRK; an endosomal acidic insulinase, which degrades intra-endosomal insulin; and IRK-associated PTPs, which dephosphorylate and, hence, deactivate the IRK. Therefore, the internalization of IRKs is central to insulin signalling and its regulation."

Fixed-ratio combinations of GLP-1RAs and insulin are also recommended when either of these molecules fail to achieve glycaemic control.

Still, there are substantial shortcomings in diabetes therapy: the blood-glucose lowering effect of OADs is often limited, incretin mimetics often induce gastrointestinal side effects and insulins still induce hypoglycaemia and weight gain in many patients.This review evaluates on-going developments of antidiabetic drugs for their potential for future therapy focussing on injectable therapies. Recent data from dual agonists, in particular tirzepatide, a combination of GIP- and GLP-1 receptor agonists, show unprecedented reductions in HbA1c, body weight and cardiovascular risk factors. Once-weekly administrations of incretin mimetics open up the potential of a combination with once-weekly insulins that have been shown to have low peak-to-trough fluctuations. Eventually, it might be feasible to administer incretins and insulins (combinations) orally. While this has already been achieved for incretins, there are still some challenges for the oral application of insulin. Nevertheless, many promising data of novel antidiabetic drugs clearly indicate that therapy of people with diabetes will become easier, safer and more efficacious in the next years."

However, insulin receptors are also expressed on a range of cells that are not canonically implicated in glucose homeostasis. This includes immune cells, where the anti-inflammatory effects of insulin have been repeatedly reported. However, recent findings have also implicated a more involved role for insulin in shaping the immune response during an infection. This includes the ability of insulin to modulate immune cell differentiation and polarisation as well as the modulation of effector functions such as biocidal ROS production. Finally, inflammatory mediators can through both direct and indirect mechanisms also regulate serum insulin levels, suggesting that insulin may be co-opted by the immune system during an infection to direct immunological operations. Collectively, these observations implicate insulin as a bona fide immune-modulating hormone and suggest that a better understanding of insulin's immunological function may aid in optimising insulin therapy in a range of clinical settings."

The concentrated insulin formulations range from 2-fold concentration (insulin lispro 200 units/mL) with rapid-acting prandial action to 5-fold concentration (human regular insulin, 500 units/mL) with basal and short-acting prandial actions. Long-acting basal insulins include degludec 200 units/mL and glargine 300 units/mL. Concentrated insulins have been developed with the goal of easing insulin therapy by reducing the volume and number of injections and in some cases making use of altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This review summarizes the unique characteristics of each concentrated insulin to help healthcare providers and people with diabetes understand how to best use them."

      "abstract": "The first insulin preparation capable of consistently lowering blood glucose was developed in 1921. But 100 years later, blood glucose control with insulin in people with diabetes is nearly universally suboptimal, with essentially the same molecule still delivered by the same inappropriate subcutaneous injection route. Bypassing this route with oral administration appears to have become technologically feasible, accelerating over the past 50 years, either with packaged insulin peptides or by chemical insulin mimetics. Some of the problems of prospective unregulated absorption of insulin into the circulation from subcutaneous depots might be overcome with glucose-responsive insulins. Approaches to these problems could be modification of the peptide by adducts, or the use of nanoparticles or insulin patches, which deliver insulin according to glucose concentration. Some attention has been paid to targeting insulin preferentially to different organs, either by molecular engineering of insulin, or with adducts. But all these approaches still have problems in even beginning to match the responsiveness of physiological insulin delivery to metabolic requirements, both prandially and basally. As would be expected, for all these technically complex approaches, many examples of abandoned development can be found. Meanwhile, it is becoming possible to change the duration of action of subcutaneous injected insulin analogues to act even more rapidly for meals, and towards weekly insulin for basal administration. The state of the art of all these approaches, and the barriers to success, are reviewed here."

This latter is itself a complex ranging from ambulatory care in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the topic generally addressed by guidelines and funding advice, to in-patient care and the newly diagnosed, plus secondary diabetes with very different effects on insulin need, through to co-morbidities and medications interfering with glucose metabolism. In this article the match of different clinical scenarios to the available insulins is discussed in the context of available evidence, quality guidelines, and diabetes best practice. Additionally the role of biosimilars of the insulin analogues is addressed, their limited but useful price advantage, and the management consequences of substitution for the originator product."

To mitigate acute and chronic risks of such excursions, glucose-responsive insulin-delivery technologies have long been sought for clinical application in type 1 and long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Such 'smart' systems or insulin analogues seek to provide hormonal activity proportional to blood glucose levels without external monitoring. This review highlights three broad strategies to co-optimise mean glycaemic control and time in range: (1) coupling of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to delivery devices (algorithm-based 'closed-loop' systems); (2) glucose-responsive polymer encapsulation of insulin; and (3) mechanism-based hormone modifications. Innovations span control algorithms for CGM-based insulin-delivery systems, glucose-responsive polymer matrices, bio-inspired design based on insulin's conformational switch mechanism upon insulin receptor engagement, and glucose-responsive modifications of new insulin analogues. In each case, innovations in insulin chemistry and formulation may enhance clinical outcomes. Prospects are discussed for intrinsic glucose-responsive insulin analogues containing a reversible switch (regulating bioavailability or conformation) that can be activated by glucose at high concentrations."

Over the last two decades, a plethora of new agents have emerged to help treat the condition, of which several classes of agent have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, there have been several developments in the pharmacology of insulin, improving the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin analogues to better mimic physiological insulin concentrations in the liver, skeletal muscle, and other tissues. Furthermore, the technologies used to deliver insulin and measure glucose have improved; for example, in the UK, hybrid closed loop systems are now the standard of care for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This review focuses on insulin and insulin delivery. We consider the history of insulin development and the pharmacology of newer insulin analogues. We also describe the novel technologies available and the considerations that need to be made by anaesthetists, surgeons, and other members of the perioperative team when looking after someone with diabetes mellitus on these insulins, or using these devices, to ensure safe care and the avoidance of complications."

      "abstract": "Diabetes profoundly alters fuel metabolism; both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance are characterized by inefficient mitochondrial coupling and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) despite their association with normal to high oxygen consumption. Altered mitochondrial function in diabetes can be traced to insulin's pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial proteome abundance and quality by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and preventing proteome damage and degradation, respectively. Although insulin enhances gene transcription, it also induces decreases in amino acids. Thus, if amino acid depletion is not corrected, increased transcription will not result in enhanced translation of transcripts to proteins. Mitochondrial biology varies among tissues, and although most studies in humans are performed in skeletal muscle, abnormalities have been reported in multiple organs in preclinical models of diabetes. Nutrient excess, especially fat excess, alters mitochondrial physiology by driving excess ROS emission that impairs insulin action. Excessive ROS irreversibly damages DNA and proteome with adverse effects on cellular functions. In insulin-resistant people, aerobic exercise stimulates both mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency concurrent with enhancement of insulin action. This Review discusses the association between both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant diabetes and alterations in mitochondrial proteome homeostasis and function that adversely affect cellular functions, likely contributing to many diabetic complications."

That transpired to be an overstatement, yet insulin has proven to be the lifesaver for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and an essential therapy for many with type 2 diabetes mellitus or other forms of diabetes mellitus. Since its discovery, insulin (a molecule of only 51 amino acids) has been the subject of pharmaceutical research and development that has paved the way for other protein-based therapies. From purified animal-extracted insulin and human insulin produced by genetically modified organisms to a spectrum of insulin analogues, pharmaceutical laboratories have strived to tailor the preparations to the needs of patients. Nonetheless, overall glycaemic control often remains poor as exogenous insulin is still not able to mimic the physiological insulin profile. Circumventing subcutaneous administration and the design of analogues with profiles that mimic that of physiological insulin are ongoing areas of research. Novel concepts, such as once-weekly insulins or glucose-dependent and oral insulins, are on the horizon but their real-world effectiveness still needs to be proven. Until a true cure for type 1 diabetes mellitus is found and the therapeutic arsenal for other forms of diabetes mellitus is expanded, insulin will remain central in the treatment of many people living with diabetes mellitus."

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first insulin biosimilar interchangeable product in 2021 for improving glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Several recombinant insulin products are available in the United States, including the recently approved biosimilar insulins. The approval of the biosimilar insulin products was based on comparative analytical characterizations and comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data. The primary objective of this review is to discuss the scientific considerations in the demonstration of biosimilarity of a proposed insulin biosimilar to a reference product and the role of clinical pharmacology studies in the determination of biosimilarity and interchangeability. Euglycemic clamp studies are considered a \"gold standard\" for insulin PK and PD characterization and have been widely used to determine the time-action profiles of rapid-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulin products. Clinical pharmacology aspects of study design, including selection of appropriate dose, study population, PK, and PD end points, are presented. Finally, the role of clinical pharmacology studies in the interchangeability assessment of insulin and the regulatory pathways used for insulin and the experience with follow-on insulins and the two recently approved biosimilar insulin products is discussed."

      "abstract": "Growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis may play a role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in synergism with insulin. IGF-1 can directly stimulate glucose transport into the muscle through either IGF-1 or insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors. In severely decompensated diabetes including diabetic ketoacidosis, plasma levels of IGF-1 are low and insulin delivery into the portal system is required to normalize IGF-1 synthesis and bioavailability. Normalization of serum IGF-1 correlated with the improvement of glucose homeostasis during insulin therapy providing evidence for the use of IGF-1 as biomarker of metabolic control in diabetes. Taking apart the inherent mitogenic discussion, diabetes treatment using insulins with high affinity for the IGF-1 receptor may act as an endocrine pacer exerting a cardioprotective effect by restoring the right level of IGF-1 in bloodstream and target tissues, whereas insulins with low affinity for the IGF-1 receptor may lack this positive effect. An excessive and indirect stimulation of IGF-1 receptor due to sustained and chronic hyperinsulinemia over the therapeutic level required to overtake acute/chronic insulin resistance may act as endocrine disruptor as it may possibly increase the cardiovascular risk in the short and medium term and mitogenic/proliferative action in the long term. In conclusion, normal IGF-1 may be hypothesized to be a good marker of appropriate insulin treatment of the subject with diabetes and may integrate and make more robust the message coming from HbA1c in terms of prediction of cardiovascular risk."

Human regular U-500 insulin was the first concentrated insulin introduced and it has been available in the United States since the 1950s. Humulin R is the only human regular U-500 available on the market. Human regular U-500 is five times more concentrated than U-100 and because of its pharmacodynamic properties, works as both a basal and a bolus insulin. Human regular U500 allows for delivery of a larger insulin dose with a smaller volume leading to better absorption compared to U-100 and has traditionally been used in patients with moderate to severe insulin resistance. More recently other forms of concentrated insulin have become available and the newer concentrated insulin preparations can be used in diabetic patients with or without insulin resistance. Our intent is to provide primary care physicians with a review of the pharmacology and current literature on concentrated insulins as well as recommendations for patient selection, dose initiation, and dose adjustment."

Despite the availability of these follow-on products, the price of insulin has remained stubbornly high. New regulatory guidance under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovations Act that came into effect in March 2020 introduced an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar insulins and introduced the option to apply for interchangeability of the biosimilar insulin with the reference product. This abbreviated clinical testing may open the doors for numerous follow-on insulin products, with unknown supply-chain and fiscal ramifications. This review will highlight the development process of biosimilar insulin in the US and the recent regulatory changes that can aid this process. We will also discuss challenges for prescribers and patients who are navigating this ever-changing landscape.

Its injectable delivery mode, propensity for weight gain and hypoglycaemia, and the paucity of trials assessing the risk-to-safety ratio of early insulin use are major shortcomings associated with its use in patients with type 2 diabetes. Development of new insulins-such as insulin analogues, including long-acting and short-acting insulins-now provide alternative treatment options to human insulin. These novel insulin formulations and innovative insulin delivery methods, such as oral or inhaled insulin, have been developed with the aim to reduce insulin-associated hypoglycaemia, lower intraindividual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability, and improve imitation of physiological insulin release. Availability of newer glucose-lowering drugs (such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors) also offers the opportunity for combination treatment; the results of the first trials in this area of research suggest that such treatment might lead to use of reduced insulin doses, less weight gain, and fewer hypoglycaemic episodes than insulin treatment alone. These and future developments will hopefully offer better opportunities for individualisation of insulin treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes."

Improvements in the PK/PD characteristics of today's SC insulins provide more physiologic coverage of basal and prandial insulin requirements than regular human insulin; however, they do not achieve the rapid on/rapid off characteristics of endogenously secreted insulin seen in healthy, nondiabetic individuals. Pulmonary administration of prandial insulin represents an attractive option that overcomes limitations of SC insulin by providing more a rapid onset of action and a faster return of action to baseline levels than SC administration of rapid-acting insulin analogs.

In Hungary, the prevalence of known diabetic adults exceeds 9.1%, causing increased economical and medical burden to the society. It is obvious that there is a considerable urge to develop novel, safer and more efficient antidiabetic drugs. Therefore, studies have been focusing on the beneficial or detrimental side effects of antidiabetic drugs besides their general metabolic effects. Every anti-diabetic agent has an indirect anti-tumor effect as a consequence of lowering blood glucose levels and controlling carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism. In addition, most agents have their own direct antitumor effects, on the other hand, some may play a negligible role in cancer promotion. While the latter possibility is based mainly on pre-clinical, experimental data or on short-duration clinical studies, the informations about the safety of antidiabetic drugs are verified by large-scale, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials. Nowadays, metformin is the only drug that has been shown to reduce cancer risk in a variety of tumor localizations in monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents and insulins, and even in combination with certain cytostatics and biological therapies. The available data about the role of other antidiabetics in tumor prevention are less clear or insufficient. Here, we review the available \u2013 sometimes contradictory \u2013 literature about the relationship of tumor and antidiabet ics, verifying the safety of antidiabetics. Here, we propose that in the future tumor-specifically optimized antidiabetic treatment may play a role in tumor prevention or even in specific oncotherapy in patients with or without diabetes."

The neonatal fat is the result of triglyceride synthesis and deposition stimulated by elevated fetal insulin levels combined with insulin's mitogenic activity directly stimulating the growth of the white adipocytes. Fetal insulin levels are determined by fetal glucose and some amino acids such as arginine. Although the placenta plays a key role in providing maternally derived nutrients to the growing fetus, there is currently no evidence that it actively contributes to an excessive maternal-to-fetal glucose flux at the end of gestation. Early in gestation, the maternal environment in diabesity, and in particular the glucose-insulin axis, can modify placental growth and development, which may contribute to an enhanced glucose flux to the fetus already early in pregnancy. This may have long-lasting effects on the fetal pancreas and accelerate beta-cell maturation. The association of fetal and neonatal insulin levels and the proportion of body fat with obesity later in the offspring's life calls for interventions during pregnancy to prevent or reduce fetal hyperinsulinaemia. Dietary and/or physical activity interventions initiated before or in early pregnancy would likely be most effective. Results from the very few studies with fetal insulin as the outcome are inconsistent. However, there is a major lack of randomized intervention trials on this topic."

      "abstract": "Insulin is the primary acute anabolic coordinator of nutrient partitioning. Hyperglycemia is the main stimulant of insulin secretion, but other nutrients such as specific amino acids, fatty acids, and ketoacids can potentiate pancreatic insulin release. Incretins are intestinal hormones with insulinotropic activity and are secreted in response to food ingestion, thus integrating diet chemical composition with the regulation of insulin release. In addition, prolactin is required for proper islet development, and it stimulates \u03b2-cell proliferation. Counterintuitively, bacterial components appear to signal insulin secretion. In vivo lipopolysaccharide infusion acutely increases circulating insulin, which is paradoxical as endotoxemia is a potent catabolic condition. Insulin is a potent anabolic orchestrator of nutrient partitioning, and this is particularly true in adipocytes. Insulin dictates lipid accretion in a dose-dependent manner during preadipocyte development in adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular cell culture. However, in vivo studies focused on insulin's role in regulating adipose tissue metabolism from growing, and market weight pigs are sometimes inconsistent, and this variability appears to be animal, age and depot dependent. Additionally, porcine adipose tissue synthesizes and secretes a number of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and so forth) that directly or indirectly influence insulin action. Therefore, because insulin has an enormous impact on agriculturally important phenotypes, it is critical to have a better understanding of how insulin homeostasis is governed."

The last several decades have witnessed enormous scientific progress in the therapy of type 1 diabetes, yet some developments have been incremental, and insulin is not a cure. Herein, I highlight key scientific advances potentially poised to improve the quality of life and treatment outcomes in type 1 diabetes. These innovations range from newer insulin analogues to the development of smart insulins, oral and weekly insulins, glucose sensors and closed-loop insulin-delivery devices, as well as strategies for durable human beta cell replacement coupled with selective immune manipulation to preserve beta cell function. Finally, progress in the prediction and prevention of type 1 diabetes highlights the ongoing challenges and potential for altering the natural history of the disease or eliminating type 1 diabetes altogether."

Teplizumab, the first immunotherapy treatment to delay the onset of clinical type 1 diabetes, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Other immune-based therapies show promise in preserving \u03b2-cell function. Public health screening using islet autoantibodies is expanding, enabling earlier diagnosis, reducing diabetic ketoacidosis, and allowing timely introduction of disease-modifying treatments before the need for insulin therapy. \u03b2-cell replacement is shifting from traditional transplantation of organ donor islets and the pancreas to stem cell-derived \u03b2 cells. Bioengineering methods, such as encapsulation, and gene editing to create hypoimmune cells could reduce the need for immunosuppression that has hampered \u03b2-cell replacement, and patient-derived stem cells open doors to personalised therapies. Although these innovations have been made available to a small number of patients, scaling them to widespread use remains a challenge. Meanwhile, glucose regulation is improving through the use of automated insulin delivery systems that combine glucose monitoring with insulin pumps. New-generation insulins (those that are ultrarapid, ultralong, and glucose-responsive) improve outcomes by minimising blood sugar fluctuations. Together, these breakthroughs offer renewed hope for improving long-term management and quality of life for people living with type 1 diabetes."

Intranasally administered insulin offers a non-invasive approach for isolating and investigating brain insulin action. This systematic review synthesized the effects of acute intranasal insulin on neuroimaging, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes reported in 48 studies in adults. Age, sex, body mass index, and insulin resistance were found to moderate brain insulin action. Neuroimaging studies showed insulin affects brain activity, cerebral blood flow, and functional connectivity in regions like the hypothalamus, amygdala, and insula. Insulin also modified cognitive function, eating behaviour, and the stress response. Nonetheless, inconsistencies in study designs, dosages, and outcome measures necessitate standardized methodologies to better understand central insulin action. Taken together, insulin's ability to modify stress and fear, appetite and eating behaviour, and cognitive function in both healthy and diseased individuals highlight its potential in the therapeutic and mechanistic exploration of highly prevalent psychiatric, metabolic, and cognitive conditions like mood disorders, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease."

Adipocytes sequester triglyceride (TG) in fed conditions stimulated by insulin, while in fasting catecholamines trigger TG hydrolysis, releasing glycerol and fatty acids (FAs). These antagonistic hormone actions result in part from insulin's ability to inhibit cAMP levels generated through such G-protein-coupled receptors as catecholamine-activated \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Consistent with these antagonistic signaling modes, acute actions of catecholamines cause insulin resistance. Yet, paradoxically, chronically activating adipocytes by catecholamines cause increased glucose tolerance, as does insulin. Recent results have helped to unravel this conundrum by revealing enhanced complexities of these hormones' signaling networks, including identification of unexpected common signaling nodes between these canonically antagonistic hormones."

The meta-analysis found no differences between long-acting biosimilar and originator insulins with regard to reduction in glycated haemoglobin at 24 weeks (0.04%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.01, 0.08; P for efficacy = .14, I 2 = 0%) or at 52 weeks (0.03%, 95% CI -0.04, 0.1), or reduction in fasting plasma glucose (0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.36, 0.53), hypoglycaemia (odds ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.96, 1.03), mortality, injection site reactions, insulin antibodies and allergic reactions. Analyses stratified by type of diabetes and prior insulin use yielded similar findings. Similarly, no significant differences were found between short-acting biosimilar and originator insulins. In summary, our meta-analysis showed no significant differences in clinical efficacy and safety, including immune reactions, between biosimilar and originator insulins.

However, for patients with diabetes, exercise can also lead to challenges in maintaining blood glucose balance, particularly if patients are prescribed insulin or certain oral hypoglycemic agents. Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse event associated with exercise and insulin therapy, and the fear of hypoglycemia is also the greatest barrier to exercise for many patients. With the appropriate insulin dose adjustments and, in some cases, carbohydrate supplementation, blood glucose levels can be better managed during exercise and in recovery. In general, insulin strategies that help facilitate weight loss with regular exercise and recommendations around exercise adjustments to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often not discussed with patients because the recommendations can be complex and may differ from one individual to the next. This is a review of the current published literature on insulin dose adjustments and starting-point strategies for patients with diabetes in preparation for safe exercise."

In particular, due to the steadily increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, an adequate control of the circulating amount of insulin is desirable. In addition, also in forensics and doping control analysis, the determination of insulin in blood, urine or other biological matrices plays a major role. However, in order to establish general reference values for insulin and C-peptide for diabetology, the comparability of measured concentrations is indispensable. This has not yet been fully implemented, although enormous progress has been made in recent years, and the search for a \"gold standard\" method is still ongoing. In addition to established ligand-binding assays, an increasing number of mass-spectrometric methods have been developed and employed as the to-date available systems (for example, high-resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometers) provide the sensitivity required to determine analyte concentrations in the sub-ng/mL (sub-100pmol/L) level. Meanwhile, also high-throughput measurements have been realized to meet the requirement of testing a high number of samples in a short period of time. Further developments aim at enabling the online measurement of insulin in the blood with the help of an insulin sensor and, in the following, in addition to a brief review, today's state of the art testing developments are summarized."

However, the mechanistic connection between MAFLD and impaired insulin action remains unclear. In this Perspective, we review data from humans to elucidate insulin's aetiological role in MAFLD. We focus particularly on the relative preservation of insulin's stimulation of triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis despite its waning ability to curb hepatic glucose production (HGP). To explain this apparent 'selective insulin resistance', we propose that hepatocellular processes that lead to TG accumulation require less insulin signal transduction, or 'insulinization,' than do those that regulate HGP. As such, mounting hyperinsulinaemia that barely compensates for aberrant HGP in insulin-resistant states more than suffices to maintain hepatic TG biosynthesis. Thus, even modestly elevated or context-inappropriate insulin levels, when sustained day and night within a heavily pro-lipogenic metabolic milieu, may translate into substantial cumulative TG biosynthesis in the insulin-resistant state."

In the present study, the influence of intranasal insulin on gustatory sensitivity was investigated using intranasal applications of insulin or placebo in a double-blind manner alongside a control condition without any application. We hypothesised that, because it mediates satiety, intranasal insulin alters gustatory sensitivity, whereas placebo application and the control should not alter gustatory sensitivity. We did not expect the sensitivity to the different taste solutions to differ. Sweet, salty, bitter and sour liquids in four concentrations each were sprayed onto the tongue of healthy male subjects. Additionally, water with no taste was applied to enable calculation of taste sensitivity in terms of parameter d' of signal detection theory. The task of the subject was to identify the quality of the respective tastant. Gustatory sensitivity and blood parameters were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVAs. Gustatory sensitivity (implying all tastants) improved significantly after intranasal insulin application compared to the application of placebo, although it did not reach significance compared to the control condition. Subjects performed best when detecting the sweet taste and worst when detecting the bitter taste. The blood parameters glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment and leptin did not differ with respect to insulin or placebo condition, nor did they differ regarding measurements preceding or following intranasal application, in confirmation of preserved peripheral euglycaemia during the experiment. Thus, it can be concluded that the application of intranasal insulin led to an improved gustatory sensitivity compared to placebo."

Aversion to basal insulin therapy contributes to unnecessary hyperglycemia and poorer outcomes for patients. Primary care physicians often make decisions regarding the initiation of basal insulin in T2D, as they work closely with patients and are well placed to discuss and manage the transition to basal insulin therapy. However, many primary care clinicians hesitate to initiate basal insulin due to concerns regarding time or effort needed to educate patients, doubts about patient acceptance or ability to manage titration or injection, or patient fears of hypoglycemia. Resistance to basal insulin therapy is often linked to the outdated perception that the need for insulin represents a failure to control the disease, or that insulin is dangerous or toxic. Time concerns can be addressed via group classes and mobile technology and by working with diabetes educators in the community. Hypoglycemia or weight gain can be minimized with proper titration and use of second-generation basal insulins. This article reviews strategies for the initiation of basal insulin therapy, with an emphasis on the characteristics and titration of second-generation basal insulins, introducing current guidelines and offering suggestions for recognizing and overcoming barriers to insulin therapy in the management of T2D."

Therefore, the knowledge of PK/PD properties might help a practitioner to design, implement and manage insulin replacement therapy effectively and averting adverse events. Present study reports the comparative analysis of PK/PD profile of various insulin analogs based on the concurrent information about clinical aspects.

T2DM is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by insulin resistance as well as \u03b2-cell dysfunction. It is widely accepted that in the face of insulin resistance, euglycemia can be maintained by increase in pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass and insulin secretion. This compensation is largely due to enhanced secretion of insulin by the \u03b2-cell mass, which is present initially, and thereby subsequent increases in \u03b2-cell mass provide additional insulin secretion. However, the mechanism by which \u03b2-cell anatomical plasticity and functional plasticity for insulin secretion is coordinated and executed in different physiological and pathophysiological states is complex and has been poorly understood. As the incidence of T2DM continues to increase at an alarming rate, it is becoming imperative to shift the research focus towards the \u03b2-cell physiology where identification of novel pathways that influence the \u03b2-cell proliferation and/or contribute to increase insulin secretion has the potential to lead to new therapies for preventing or delaying onset of disease."

      "abstract": "The major abnormality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is insulin deficiency. The methods of replacing insulin have improved throughout the decades, but hypoglycemia is still the limiting factor for many individuals with diabetes, and it prevents them from achieving ideal glycemic targets. New insulin and newer delivery systems are being developed that can improve some of the limitations of current insulins or make the delivery of insulins more acceptable for some patients. Extending the duration of action of basal insulins and shortening the peak of fast-acting insulins may have advantages for individuals with diabetes. Different delivery systems may make insulin more acceptable to patients and may have other advantages, which may aid in attaining better glycemic control."

      "abstract": "Insulin is a small protein crucial for regulating the blood glucose level in all animals. Since 1922 it has been used for the treatment of patients with diabetes. Despite consisting of just 51 amino acids, insulin contains 17 of the proteinogenic amino acids, A- and B-chains, three disulfide bridges, and it folds with 3 \u03b1-helices and a short \u03b2-sheet segment. Insulin associates into dimers and further into hexamers with stabilization by Zn 2+ and phenolic ligands. Selective chemical modification of proteins is at the forefront of developments in chemical biology and biopharmaceuticals. Insulin's structure has made it amenable to organic and inorganic chemical reactions. This Review provides a synthetic organic chemistry perspective on this small protein. It gives an overview of key chemical and physico-chemical aspects of the insulin molecule, with a focus on chemoselective reactions. This includes N-acylations at the N-termini or at Lys B29 by pH control, introduction of protecting groups on insulin, binding of metal ions, ligands to control the nano-scale assembly of insulin, and more."

By August, 1921, Banting and his student assistant Charles H Best had prepared an effective extract from a canine pancreas. In January, 1922, biochemist James B Collip isolated insulin that was sufficiently pure for human use. On Oct 25, 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin. Here, we recount the most relevant events before and after the fateful early morning of Oct 31, 1920, which culminated in the discovery and clinical use of insulin."

Lives of people with diabetes were changed forever, considering that in the pre-insulin era this was a deadly condition. Insulin, right after its discovery, became the first hormone to be purified for human use, the first to be unraveled in its amino acid sequence and to be synthetized by DNA-recombinant technique, the first to be modified in its amino acid sequence to modify its duration of action. As such the discovery of insulin represents a pivotal point in medical history. Since the early days of its production, insulin has been improved in its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in the attempt to faithfully reproduce diurnal physiologic plasma insulin fluctuations. The evolution of insulin molecule has been paralleled by evolution in the way the hormone is administered. Once-weekly insulins will be available soon, and glucose-responsive \"smart\" insulins start showing their potential in early clinical studies. The first century of insulin as therapy was marked by relentless search for better formulations, a search that has not stopped yet. New technologies may have, indeed, the potential to provide further improvement of safety and efficacy of insulin therapy and, therefore, contribute to improvement of the quality of life of people with diabetes."

Despite this, glycemic control remains suboptimal in many people with diabetes. Although postprandial glucose control has been improved with the development of subcutaneously injected rapid-acting insulin analogs, currently available insulins are not able to fully mimic the physiological time-action profile of endogenously secreted insulin after a meal. The delayed onset of metabolic action and prolonged period of effect induce the risk of postprandial hyperglycemia and late postprandial hypoglycemia. A number of alternative routes of insulin administration have been investigated over time in an attempt to overcome the limitations associated with subcutaneous administration and to provide an improved time-action insulin profile more closely simulating physiological prandial insulin release. Among these, pulmonary insulin delivery has shown the most promise. Technosphere\u00ae Inhaled Insulin (TI) is a rapid-acting inhaled human insulin recently approved by the FDA for prandial insulin therapy. In this article we discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of TI, and, based on key studies performed during its clinical development, the implications for improved postprandial glucose control."

Oral nanoinsulin has been developed, reaping the physiologic benefits of peroral administration. This review profiles intestinal receptors exploitable in targeted delivery of oral nanoinsulin. Intestinal receptor targeting improves oral insulin bioavailability and sustains blood glucose-lowering response. Nonetheless, these studies are conducted in small animal models with no optimization of insulin dose, targeting ligand type and content, and physicochemical and molecular biologic characteristics of nanoparticles against the in vivo/clinical diabetes responses as a function of the intestinal receptor population characteristics with diabetes progression. The interactive effects between nanoinsulin and antidiabetic drugs on intestinal receptors, including their up-/downregulation, are uncertain. Sweet taste receptors upregulate SGLT-1, and both have an undefined role as new intestinal targets of nanoinsulin. Receptor targeting of oral nanoinsulin represents a viable approach that is relatively green, requiring an in-depth development of the relationship between receptors and their pathophysiological profiles with physicochemical attributes of the oral nanoinsulin. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Intestinal receptor targeting of oral nanoinsulin improves its bioavailability with sustained blood glucose-lowering response. Exploring new intestinal receptor and tailoring the design of oral nanoinsulin to the pathophysiological state of diabetic patients is imperative to raise the insulin performance to a comparable level as the injection products."

Although insulin normally promotes anabolic metabolism in the liver by increasing glucose consumption and lipid synthesis, insulin-resistant individuals fail to inhibit hepatic glucose production and paradoxically have increased liver lipid synthesis, leading to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Here, we detail the intrahepatic and extrahepatic pathways mediating insulin's control of glucose and lipid metabolism. We propose that the interplay between both of these pathways controls insulin signaling and that mis-regulation between the 2 results in the paradoxic effects seen in the insulin-resistant liver instead of the commonly proposed deficiencies in particular branches of only the direct hepatic pathway."

Clinical expert and international diabetes organizations' position statements support the management of good glycemia during acute physical exercise by adjusting exogenous insulin and/or carbohydrate intake. Yet research has detailed, and patients frequently report, variable blood glucose responses following both the same physical exercise session and insulin to carbohydrate alteration. One important source of this variability is insulin delivery to the circulation. With modern insulin analogs, it is important to understand how different insulins, their delivery methods, and inherent physiological factors, influence the reproducibility of insulin absorption from the injection site into circulation. Furthermore, contrary to the adaptive pancreatic response to exercise in the person without diabetes, the physiological and metabolic shifts with exercise may increase circulating insulin concentrations that may contribute to exercise-related hyperinsulinemia and consequent hypoglycemia. Thus, a furthered understanding of factors underpinning insulin delivery may offer more confidence for healthcare professionals and patients when looking to improve management of glycemia around exercise."

We review early academic insights into insulin structure and its relation to self-association and receptor binding, as well as recombinant biotechnology, which have all been seminal for drug design. Recent developments have focused on combining genetic and chemical engineering with pharmaceutical optimization to generate ultra-rapid and ultra-long-acting, tissue-selective, or orally delivered insulin analogs.

Although several old studies provided conflicting results, the majority of large observational studies show strong dose-dependent associations for injected insulin with increased CV risk and worsened mortality. Insulin clearly causes weight gain, recurrent hypoglycemia, and, other potential adverse effects, including iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia. This over-insulinization with use of injected insulin predisposes to inflammation, atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart failure (HF), and arrhythmias. These associations support the findings of large-scale evaluations that strongly suggest that insulin therapy has a poorer short- and long-term safety profile than that found to many other anti-T2D therapies. The potential adverse effects of insulin therapy should be weighed against proven CV benefits noted for select other therapies for T2D as reported in recent large randomized controlled trials."

Several mechanisms of protraction have been used in pursuit of a basal insulin, for which a low injection frequency would provide tolerable and reproducible glucose control; these mechanisms have met with varying degrees of success. Before the advent of recombinant DNA technology, development focused on modifications to the formulation that increased insulin self-association, such as supplementation with zinc or the development of preformed precipitates using protamine. Indeed, NPH insulin remains widely used today despite a frequent need for a twice-daily dosing and a relatively high incidence of hypoglycaemia. The early insulin analogues used post-injection precipitation (insulin glargine U100) or dimerization and albumin binding (insulin detemir) as methods of increasing therapeutic duration. These products approached a 24-hour glucose-lowering effect with decreased variability in insulin action. Newer basal insulin analogues have used up-concentration in addition to precipitation (insulin glargine U300), and multihexamer formation in addition to albumin binding (insulin degludec), to further increase duration of action and/or decrease the day-to-day variability of the glucose-lowering profile. Clinically, the major advantage of these recent analogues has been a reduction in hypoglycaemia with similar glycated haemoglobin control when compared with earlier products. Future therapies may bring clinical benefits through hepato-preferential insulin receptor binding or very long durations of action, perhaps enabling once-weekly administration and the potential for further clinical benefits."

The discoveries of insulin and leptin, in 1922 and 1994, respectively, arose out of radically different scientific environments. Despite the dearth of scientific tools available in 1922, insulin's discovery rapidly launched a life-saving therapy for what we now know to be type I diabetes, and continually enhanced insulin therapeutics are now effectively applied to both major forms of this increasingly prevalent disease. In contrast, although the discovery of leptin provided deep insights into the regulation of central nervous system energy balance circuits, as well as an effective therapy for an extremely rare form of obesity, its therapeutic impact beyond that has been surprisingly limited. Despite an enormous accumulated body of information, many important questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms of action and role in disease of both hormones. Additionally, although many decades apart, both discoveries reveal the complexities inherent to scientific collaboration and the assignment of credit, even when the efforts are spectacularly successful."

However, the origin of these symptoms and their relationship to pathology and cognitive disorders remain poorly understood. Insulin is a hormone involved in the control of peripheral and central energy homeostasis, and insulin-resistant state has been linked to increased risk of dementia. It is now well established that brain insulin resistance can exacerbate Tau lesions. Conversely, recent data indicate that Tau protein can modulate insulin signalling in the brain, creating a vicious circle precipitating the pathological AD. This review aims to highlight our current understanding of the role of insulin in the brain and its relationship with Tau protein in the context of AD and Tauopathies."

We then consider in some detail how insulin and exercise each modulate muscle perfusion at both the microvascular and whole tissue level. The central role of the vascular endothelial cell in modulating both perfusion and transendothelial insulin and nutrient transport is also reviewed. The relationship between muscle metabolic insulin resistance and the vascular action of insulin in muscle continues to indicate an important role for the microvasculature as a target for insulin action and that impairing insulin's microvascular action significantly affects body glucose metabolism."

Bierman, MD, an exemplary scientist, mentor, and leader in the field of diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis. The award and lecture recognizes a leading scientist in the field of macrovascular complications and contributing risk factors in diabetes. George L. King, MD, of the Section of Vascular Cell Biology and Complications, Dianne Nunnally Hoppes Laboratory for Diabetes Complications, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, received the prestigious award at the American Diabetes Association's 75th Scientific Sessions, 5-9 June 2015, in Boston, MA. He presented the Edwin Bierman Award Lecture, \"Selective Insulin Resistance and the Development of Cardiovascular Disease in Diabetes,\" on Sunday, 7 June 2015.This review is focused on the factors and potential mechanisms that are causing various cardiovascular pathologies. In diabetes, insulin's actions on the endothelium and other vascular cells have significant influence on systemic metabolisms and the development of cardiovascular pathologies. Our studies showed that insulin receptors on the endothelium are important for insulin transport across the endothelial barrier and mediate insulin's actions in muscle, heart, fat, and the brain. Insulin actions on the vascular cells are mediated by two pathways involving the actions of either IRS/PI3K/Akt or Grb/Shc/MAPK. Insulin's activation of IRS/PI3K/Akt results in mostly antiatherogenic actions, as this pathway induces activation of eNOS, the expressions of HO-1 and VEGF, and the reduction of VCAM-1. In contrast, insulin's activation of the Grb/Shc/MAPK pathway mediates the expressions of ET-1 and PAI-1 and migration and proliferation of contractile cells, which have proatherogenic actions. Elevated levels of glucose, free fatty acids, and inflammatory cytokines due to diabetes and insulin resistance selectively inhibit insulin's antiatherogenic actions via the IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway. This review provides evidence to support the importance of insulin actions in preventing cardiovascular pathology that can be selectively inhibited via the IRS/PI3K/Akt cascade in diabetes."

      "abstract": "Epidemiological data have shown that metabolic disease can increase the propensity for developing cognitive decline and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). While this interaction is not completely understood, clinical studies suggest that both hyper- and hypoinsulinemia are associated with an increased risk for developing AD. Indeed, insulin signaling is altered in post-mortem brain tissue from AD patients and treatments known to enhance insulin signaling can improve cognitive function. Further, clinical evidence has shown that AD patients and mouse models of AD often display alterations in peripheral metabolism. Since insulin is primarily derived from the periphery, it is likely that changes in peripheral insulin levels lead to alterations in central nervous system (CNS) insulin signaling and could contribute to cognitive decline and pathogenesis. Developing a better understanding of the relationship between alterations in peripheral metabolism and cognitive function might provide a foundation for the development of better treatment options for patients with AD. In this article we will begin to piece together the present data defining this relationship by briefly discussing insulin signaling in the periphery and CNS, its role in cognitive function, insulin's relationship to AD, peripheral metabolic alterations in mouse models of AD and how information from these models helps understand the mechanisms through which these changes potentially lead to impairments in insulin signaling in the CNS, and potential ways to target insulin signaling that could improve cognitive function in AD.

This story begins in the 19th century with the recognition that diabetes is a disease of hyperglycemia that arises because of the absence of a pancreatic hormone, that rapidly leads to death in people classified as having \"thin diabetes\" and that is linked to serious end-organ damage and other health consequences in people identified as having \"fat diabetes.\" It continues with the recognition that pancreatic extracts can treat this problem in de-pancreatectomized dogs, and culminates with the dogged determination of a young, newly certified Canadian physician, Frederick Banting. Together with his supervisor, Professor John J.R. MacLeod (head of physiology at the University of Toronto), Banting, Charles H. Best (a physiology student) and James Collip (a professor of biochemistry at the University of Alberta, on sabbatical leave in Toronto) repeated these dog experiments and then successfully tested a purified pancreatic extract in a 13-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes in January 1922. This first successful test was followed by the rapid development and dissemination of the technology for insulin production worldwide. These events and insulin therapy's lifesaving effects on people with type 1 diabetes led to the awarding of the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Banting and MacLeod, who shared their awards with Best and Collip."

      "abstract": "Insulin has been discovered for more than a century; however, its benefits to people with diabetes are yet to be fully realized due to barriers related to access, quality of care and costs. Insulin therapy remains the cornerstone of diabetes management. The multicausality of diabetes and its subtypes calls for comprehensive phenotyping and use of biomarkers to ensure timely use of insulin to achieve early glycaemic control for long-term benefits. Biosimilar insulins are biologic products that closely resemble originator insulins without significant differences in safety or efficacy. The lower investment costs needed for research and development make biosimilar insulin more affordable to improve access. While the efficacy of insulin products is proven in controlled settings, real world evidence (RWE) from real world data (RWD) plays a crucial role in assessing the safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, adherence to and impacts of different insulin products, including biosimilars, on clinical outcomes. In this narrative review, we summarized the trends of insulin use and patterns of biosimilar insulin utilization in real world practice across different regions. We reviewed RWE on clinical safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of biosimilar insulin, as well as therapeutic inertia and non-adherence with insulin therapy. We also highlighted barriers to insulin adherence and enablers for persistence, along with potential solutions to promote the use of insulin and technologies for optimizing glycaemic control in different subtypes of diabetes. During our extensive literature review, we identified data gaps in the usage of biosimilar insulin in real world practice. We advocate for implementing a diabetes register designed fit-for-purpose, managed by a trained doctor-nurse team with system support, to generate RWE. By setting up registers with structured data collection, we can generate high quality data for integrative analysis with electronic health records (EHR) and health claims to evaluate the impacts of insulin products and other diabetes programmes on clinical outcomes, quality of life and healthcare costs to inform practice and policies. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Diabetes affects approximately 10.5% of the global population and insulin is a vital treatment for diabetes management. Insulin was discovered more than a century ago, although its benefits to people with diabetes are yet to be fully realized due to barriers related to access, quality of care, and costs. Real-world evidence from real-world data plays a crucial role in assessing the safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, adherence to, and impacts of different insulin products, including biosimilars, on clinical outcomes. In this publication, the authors provided a detailed review of the patterns of use and cost-effectiveness of biosimilar insulin, and identified major data gaps. The authors explained the methodology, utility, and limitations of generating real-world evidence based on real-world data from sources such as registers, electronic health records and health claims for assessing treatment effectiveness and safety. The authors proposed the implementation of a purpose-built diabetes register with structured data collection, managed by a trained doctor-nurse team with system support. These high-quality data can be integrated with electronic health records and health claims for evaluation of interventions, including insulin on outcomes, quality of life, and costs to inform practice and policy. Based on these premises and available data, the authors summarized trends in insulin use including biosimilar insulin, and reviewed real-world evidence on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of these products. They also identified barriers like therapeutic inertia and non-adherence, discussed enablers for persistence, and proposed solutions to evaluate the impacts of insulin products and other diabetes programs on clinical outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare costs to inform practice and policies."

However, the effects of metformin on microvascular function and microvascular insulin action specifically are poorly defined. In this mini-review, we summarize what is currently known about metformin's beneficial impact on both microvascular function and the microvascular response to insulin while highlighting methodologic issues in the literature that limit straightforward mechanistic understanding of these effects. We examine potential mechanisms for these effects based on pharmacologically dosed studies and propose that metformin may improve human microvascular insulin resistance by attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Finally, we explore several important evidence gaps and discuss avenues for future investigation that may clarify whether metformin's ability to improve microvascular insulin sensitivity is linked to its positive impact on vascular outcomes."

In 2015 and 2016, new concentrated products have been introduced that are available exclusively in pen devices that perform the conversion automatically, and thus, help to bypass the necessity for confusing calculations or administration. Providers and patients accustomed to traditional methods must recognize the differences and utility of these products to avoid dosing errors, as there are major differences in dosing procedures as well as their role in clinical practice. For example, the novel concentrated insulins (aside from U-500 products) are not solely indicated for severe insulin resistance. Use of novel agents may decrease the number of injections required, decrease complexity for patients and providers, reduce errors, and avoid conversion calculations. It is imperative that clinicians appreciate the nuances among the agents to choose an insulin product that is appropriate and fits a patient's needs and preferences."

With a worsening global diabetes epidemic and its significant health budget imposition, there is a great demand for new analogues possessing improved physical and functional properties. However, the chemical synthesis of insulin's intricate 51-amino acid, two-chain, three-disulfide bond structure, together with the poor physicochemical properties of both the individual chains and the hormone itself, has long represented a major challenge to organic chemists. This review provides a timely overview of the past efforts to chemically assemble this fascinating hormone using an array of strategies to enable both correct folding of the two chains and selective formation of disulfide bonds. These methods not only have contributed to general peptide synthesis chemistry and enabled access to the greatly growing numbers of insulin-like and cystine-rich peptides but also, today, enable the production of insulin at the synthetic efficiency levels of recombinant DNA expression methods. They have led to the production of a myriad of novel analogues with optimized structural and functional features and of the feasibility for their industrial manufacture."

      "abstract": "Measurement of insulin and its therapeutic analogs is important in diabetes, hypoglycemia, sports anti-doping and toxicology. Commercial insulin immunoassays fail to detect commonly prescribed insulin analogs. Because of their unique sequences and masses, these analogs are readily measured and distinguished with mass spectrometric (MS) assays. Reviewed here is an insulin mass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA) that combines micro-scale immunoaffinity capture with sensitive MS detection of insulin and its therapeutic analogs. An antibody reactive to all insulin analogs was used to affinity capture the insulin analogs. Following elution, insulins were detected with MALDI-TOF MS or LC-MS analysis. Isotopic resolution for insulin was achieved for both MS techniques, and several insulin analogs were detected at unique m/z signals. Porcine insulin, spiked in all samples, served as an internal reference standard for quantification. Linear standard curves spanning three orders of magnitude were obtained, with limits of detection of 15pM for the MALDI-TOF MS and 1.5pM for the LC-MS. This insulin assay was capable of detecting and quantifying not only human endogenous insulin, but also most of the therapeutic insulin analogs, which could find use in diagnosis of severe hypoglycemia and in sports anti-doping."

      "abstract": "Insulin signaling is vital for regulating cellular metabolism, growth, and survival pathways, particularly in tissues such as adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, and brain. Its role in the heart, however, is less well-explored. The heart, requiring significant ATP to fuel its contractile machinery, relies on insulin signaling to manage myocardial substrate supply and directly affect cardiac muscle metabolism. This review investigates the insulin-heart axis, focusing on insulin's multifaceted influence on cardiac function, from metabolic regulation to the development of physiological cardiac hypertrophy. A central theme of this review is the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and its profound implications for cardiac health. We discuss the intricate molecular mechanisms by which insulin signaling modulates glucose and fatty acid metabolism in cardiomyocytes, emphasizing its pivotal role in maintaining cardiac energy homeostasis. Insulin resistance disrupts these processes, leading to significant cardiac metabolic disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, subcellular signaling abnormalities, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These factors collectively contribute to the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular diseases. Insulin resistance is linked to hypertrophy, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and systolic heart failure, exacerbating the risk of coronary artery disease and heart failure. Understanding the insulin-heart axis is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate the cardiovascular complications associated with insulin resistance and diabetes."

      "abstract": "One hundred years after its discovery, insulin remains the life-saving therapy for many patients with diabetes. It has been a 100-years-old success story thanks to the fact that insulin therapy has continuously integrated the knowledge developed over a century. In 1982, insulin becomes the first therapeutic protein to be produced using recombinant DNA technology. The first \"mini\" insulin pump and the first insulin pen become available in 1983 and 1985, respectively. In 1996, the first generation of insulin analogues were produced. In 1999, the first continuous glucose-monitoring device for reading interstitial glucose was approved by the FDA. In 2010s, the ultra-long action insulins were introduced. An equally exciting story developed in parallel. In 1966. Kelly et al. performed the first clinical pancreas transplant at the University of Minnesota, and now it is a well-established clinical option. First successful islet transplantations in humans were obtained in the late 1980s and 1990s. Their ability to consistently re-establish the endogenous insulin secretion was obtained in 2000s. More recently, the possibility to generate large numbers of functional human \u03b2 cells from pluripotent stem cells was demonstrated, and the first clinical trial using stem cell-derived insulin producing cell was started in 2014. This year, the discovery of this life-saving hormone turns 100 years. This provides a unique opportunity not only to celebrate this extraordinary success story, but also to reflect on the limits of insulin therapy and renew the commitment of the scientific community to an insulin free world for our patients."

There is, however, no consensus regarding the relative magnitude of these effects under physiological conditions. Extensive research over the past three decades in humans and animal models has provided discordant results between these two modes of insulin action. Here, we review the field to make the case that physiologically direct hepatic insulin action dominates acute suppression of glucose production, but that there is also a delayed, second order regulation of this process via extrahepatic effects. We further provide our views regarding the timing, dominance, and physiological relevance of these effects and discuss novel concepts regarding insulin regulation of adipose tissue fatty acid metabolism and central nervous system (CNS) signaling to the liver, as regulators of insulin's extrahepatic effects on glucose production."

Despite early challenges to productivity, more than 2,000 peer-reviewed articles on islet biology were published in 2021. Herein, we highlight noteworthy advances in islet research between January 2021 and April 2022, focussing on 5 areas. First, we discuss new insights into the role of glucokinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and mitochondrial function on insulin secretion from the pancreatic \u03b2 cell, provided by new genetically modified mouse models and live imaging. We then discuss a new connection between lipid handling and improved insulin secretion in the context of glucotoxicity, focussing on fatty acid-binding protein 4 and fetuin-A. Advances in high-throughput \"omic\" analysis evolved to where one can generate more finely tuned genetic and molecular profiles within broad classifications of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Next, we highlight breakthroughs in diabetes treatment using stem cell-derived \u03b2 cells and innovative strategies to improve islet survival posttransplantation. Last, we update our understanding of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection on pancreatic islet function and discuss current evidence regarding proposed links between COVID and new-onset diabetes. We address these breakthroughs in 2 settings: one for a scientific audience and the other for the public, particularly those living with or affected by diabetes. Bridging biomedical research in diabetes to the community living with or affected by diabetes, our partners living with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes also provide their perspectives on these latest advances in islet biology."

      "abstract": "Although previous studies suggested the protective effect of Zn for type 2 diabetes (T2D), the unitary causal effect remains inconclusive. We investigated the causal effect of Zn as a single intervention on glycaemic control for T2D, using a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR). Four primary outcomes were identified: fasting blood glucose/fasting glucose, HbA1c, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum insulin/fasting insulin level. In the systematic review, four databases were searched until June 2021. Studies, in which participants had T2D and intervention did not comprise another co-supplement, were included. Results were synthesised through the random-effects meta-analysis. In the two-sample MR, we used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from MR-base, strongly related to Zn supplements, to infer the relationship causally, but not specified T2D. In the systematic review and meta-analysis, fourteen trials were included with overall 897 participants initially. The Zn supplement led to a significant reduction in the post-trial mean of fasting blood glucose (mean difference (MD): -26\u00b752 mg/dl, 95 % CI (-35\u00b713, -17\u00b791)), HbA1c (MD: -0\u00b752 %, 95 % CI: (-0\u00b790, -0\u00b713)) and HOMA-IR (MD: -1\u00b765, 95 % CI (-2\u00b762, -0\u00b768)), compared to the control group. In the two-sample MR, Zn supplement with two SNP reduced the fasting glucose (inverse-variance weighted coefficient: -2\u00b704 mmol/l, 95 % CI (-3\u00b726, -0\u00b783)). From the two methods, Zn supplementation alone may causally improve glycaemic control among T2D patients. The findings are limited by power from the small number of studies and SNP included in the systematic review and two-sample MR analysis, respectively."

Methods: We examined serum insulin, glucose, and indices of insulin resistance [insulin:glucose molar ratio and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)] and lung cancer risk using a case-cohort study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study of Finnish men. A total of 196 cases and 395 subcohort members were included. Insulin and glucose were measured in fasting serum collected 5 to 12 years before diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to estimate the relative risk of lung cancer. Results: The average time between blood collection and lung cancer was 9.6 years. Fasting serum insulin levels were 8.7% higher in subcohort members than cases. After multivariable adjustment, men in the fourth quartile of insulin had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer than those in the first quartile [HR = 2.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-3.94]. A similar relationship was seen with HOMA-IR (HR = 1.83; 95% CI, 0.99-3.38). Risk was not strongly associated with glucose or the insulin:glucose molar ratio ( P trend = 0.55 and P trend = 0.27, respectively). Conclusions: Higher fasting serum insulin concentrations, as well as the presence of insulin resistance, appear to be associated with an elevated risk of lung cancer development. Impact: Although insulin is hypothesized to increase risk of some cancers, insulin and lung cancer remain understudied. Higher insulin levels and insulin resistance were associated with increased lung cancer risk. Although smoking cessation is the best method of lung cancer prevention, other lifestyle changes that affect insulin concentrations and sensitivity may reduce lung cancer risk.

The fixedratio combinations with molecules such as insulin degludec + liraglutide, and insulin glargine + lixisenatide have proven useful in intensifying treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this review was to evaluate and analyze the results of pivotal studies with both fixed-ratio combinations in individuals with type 2 diabetes, finding that, they are capable of achieving better glycemic control when compared with each of its components separately (with a lower risk of hypoglycemia vs basal insulin and lower risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects vs GLP-1 receptor agonists) in various clinical scenarios, especially in individuals who do not achieve control with oral antidiabetics or who do not achieve control with basal insulin (associated with oral antidiabetics) or in those under management with GLP-1RA plus oral antidiabetics."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a rapidly growing yet largely preventable chronic disease. Exaggerated increases in blood glucose concentration following meals is a primary contributor to many long-term complications of the disease that decrease quality of life and reduce lifespan. Adverse health consequences also manifest years prior to the development of T2D due to underlying insulin resistance and exaggerated postprandial concentrations of the glucose-lowering hormone insulin. Postprandial hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic excursions can be improved by exercise, which contributes to the well-established benefits of physical activity for the prevention and treatment of T2D. The aim of this review is to describe the postprandial dysmetabolism that occurs in individuals at risk for and with T2D, and highlight how acute and chronic exercise can lower postprandial glucose and insulin excursions. In addition to describing the effects of traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise on glycemic control, we highlight other forms of activity including low-intensity walking, high-intensity interval exercise, and resistance training. In an effort to improve knowledge translation and implementation of exercise for maximal glycemic benefits, we also describe how timing of exercise around meals and post-exercise nutrition can modify acute and chronic effects of exercise on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. Novelty: Exaggerated postprandial blood glucose and insulin excursions are associated with disease risk. Both a single session and repeated sessions of exercise improve postprandial glycemic control in individuals with and without T2D. The glycemic benefits of exercise can be enhanced by considering the timing and macronutrient composition of meals around exercise."

Following these discoveries, evidence of decreased brain insulin receptor number and function was reported in both clinical samples and animal models of aging and Alzheimer's disease, setting the stage for the hypothesis that neuronal insulin resistance may underlie memory loss in these conditions. The development of therapeutic insulin delivery to the brain using intranasal insulin administration has been shown to improve aspects of memory or learning in both humans and animal models. However, whether this approach functions by compensating for poorly signaling insulin receptors, for reduced insulin levels in the brain, or for reduced trafficking of insulin into the brain remains unclear. Direct measures of insulin's impact on cellular physiology and metabolism in the brain have been sparse in models of Alzheimer's disease, and even fewer studies have analyzed these processes in the aged brain. Nevertheless, recent evidence supports the role of brain insulin as a mediator of glucose metabolism through several means, including altering glucose transporters. Here, we provide a review of contemporary literature on brain insulin resistance, highlight the rationale for improving memory function using intranasal insulin, and describe initial results from experiments using a molecular approach to more directly measure the impact of insulin receptor activation and signaling on glucose uptake in neurons."

This review provides insights into the burden of hypoglycemia in the management of diabetes and outlines strategies available to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and improve patients' well-being. People with type 1 diabetes are primarily affected by hypoglycemic episodes which are associated with direct physical harms like injuries and cardiac events as well as indirect psychosocial consequences including constant anxiety, absenteeism, increased healthcare costs and overall poorer quality of life. These complications are more prominent amongst individuals with hypoglycemia unawareness or overnight hypoglycemia and could even extend to caregivers such as parents of children with diabetes. Patients experiencing frequent or severe hypoglycemic events might also develop a pathological fear of hypoglycemia and adopt aberrant behaviors intending to maintain higher blood glucose levels. Modern pharmaceutical options with a safer profile in terms of hypoglycemia are available including novel basal insulins with lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia along with ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogs with a shorter duration of action that might avert late post-meal hypoglycemia. Continuous glucose monitoring and sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with low glucose suspend technology can also prevent hypoglycemia, although concerns about cost and patient satisfaction remain. Advancements in insulin therapy and technological modalities should be coupled with ongoing education and support for patients to become co-managers of their disease and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia."

      "abstract": "Insulin production by the pancreas follows a basic pattern where basal levels of insulin are secreted during fasting periods, with prandial increases in insulin associated with food ingestion. The aim of insulin therapy in patients with diabetes is to match the endogenous pattern of insulin secretion as closely as possible without causing hypoglycaemia. There are several optimal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of long-acting basal insulins that can help to achieve this aim, namely, as follows: activity that is flat and as free of peaks as possible, a duration of action of \u226524-h, and as little day-to-day variation as possible. The long-acting basal insulins are a fundamental therapy for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and those that are currently available have many benefits; however, the development of even longer-acting insulins and improved insulin delivery techniques may lead to better glycemic control for patients in the future. Established long-acting basal insulins available in the United States and Europe include insulin glargine 100\u00a0units/mL and insulin detemir, both of which exhibit similar glycemic control to that of the intermediate-acting neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin, but with a reduction in hypoglycaemia. Newer insulin products available include new insulin glargine 300\u00a0units/mL (United States and Europe) and the ultra-long-acting insulin degludec (Europe) with basal insulin peglispro currently in development. These new insulins demonstrate different pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and longer durations of action (>24\u00a0h) compared with insulin glargine 100\u00a0units/mL, which may lead to potential benefits. The introduction of biosimilar insulins may also broaden access to insulins by reducing treatment costs. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

To have a basis for comparison, it is important to understand the activity profile and the challenges with use of the currently available concentrated insulin, regular insulin 500 units/mL (U500R). We also examine how the newer products may assist clinicians and patients with the difficulties faced with the use of U500R."

      "abstract": "Achieving optimal blood glucose control in Type 1 diabetes is a delicate balance between ensuring tight glycaemic control and achieving this without the expense of hypoglycaemia and weight gain, two major factors impacting quality of life. This is a real challenge for people with Type 1 diabetes and underpins many of the struggles they face in self-managing on a day-to-day basis. The main goals of insulin delivery are to try to simulate the physiology of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion as closely as possible and to overcome the challenges of peripheral insulin administration by achieving rapidity of onset with mealtime insulins and stability of the glucose-lowering effects of long-acting insulins. Since the early days of human insulin use, there have been many developments in insulin formulations that aim to achieve these goals as much as possible, thus contributing to better glycaemic control whilst minimizing hypoglycaemia. In the present review we discuss the currently available insulin analogues and the challenges of achieving glucose control using current analogues in those on multiple daily injections, and appraise the evidence base for newer-generation insulin analogues, such as insulin degludec, glargine U300, faster-acting insulin aspart and BioChaperone lispro. We also highlight new insulins in development and unmet needs in people with Type 1 diabetes."

      "abstract": "Advancement in all disciplines (art, science, education, and engineering) requires a careful balance of disruption and advancement of classical techniques. Often technologies are created with a limited understanding of fundamental principles and are prematurely abandoned. Over time, knowledge improves, new opportunities are identified, and technology is reassessed in a different light leading to a renaissance. Recovery of biological products is currently experiencing such a renaissance. Crystallization is one example of an elegant and ancient technology that has been applied in many fields and was employed to purify insulins from naturally occurring sources. Crystallization can also be utilized to determine protein structures. However, a multitude of parameters can impact protein crystallization and the \"hit rate\" for identifying protein crystals is relatively low, so much so that the development of a crystallization process is often viewed as a combination of art and science even today. Supplying the worldwide requirement for insulin (and associated variants) requires significant advances in process intensification to support scale of production and to minimize the overall cost to enable broader access. Expanding beyond insulin, the increasing complexity and diversity of biologics agents challenge the current purification methodologies. To harness the full potential of biologics, there is a need to fully explore a broader range of purification technologies, including nonchromatographic approaches. This impetus requires one to challenge and revisit the classical techniques including crystallization, chromatography, and filtration from a different vantage point and with a new set of tools, including molecular modeling. Fortunately, computational biophysics tools now exist to provide insights into mechanisms of protein/ligand interactions and molecular assembly processes (including crystallization) that can be used to support de novo process development. For example, specific regions or motifs of insulins and ligands can be identified and used as targets to support crystallization or purification development. Although the modeling tools have been developed and validated for insulin systems, the same tools can be applied to more complex modalities and to other areas including formulation, where the issue of aggregation and concentration-dependent oligomerization could be mechanistically modeled. This paper will illustrate a case study juxtaposing historical approaches to insulin downstream processes to a recent production process highlighting the application and evolution of technologies. Insulin production from Escherichia coli via inclusion bodies is an elegant example since it incorporates virtually all the unit operations associated with protein production-recovery of cells, lysis, solubilization, refolding, purification, and crystallization. The case study will include an example of an innovative application of existing membrane technology to combine three-unit operations into one, significantly reducing solids handling and buffer consumption. Ironically, a new separations technology was developed over the course of the case study that could further simplify and intensify the downstream process, emphasizing and highlighting the ever-accelerating pace of innovation in downstream processing. Molecular biophysics modeling was also employed to enhance the mechanistic understanding of the crystallization and purification processes."

Insulin sensitivity, not GSIS, was decreased in the Ob-NFG-IGT group compared with the Ob-NFG-NGT group, whereas GSIS, not insulin sensitivity, was decreased in the Ob-IFG-IGT and Ob-T2D groups compared with the Ob-NFG-NGT and Ob-NFG-IGT groups. Insulin clearance was directly related to insulin sensitivity and inversely related to the postprandial increase in insulin secretion and plasma insulin concentration.ConclusionIncreased adiposity per se, not insulin resistance, enhanced insulin secretion in people with obesity. The obesity-induced increase in insulin secretion, in conjunction with a decrease in insulin clearance, sufficiently raised the plasma insulin concentrations needed to maintain normoglycemia in individuals with moderate, but not severe, insulin resistance. A deterioration in \u03b2 cell function, not a decrease in insulin sensitivity, was a determinant of IFG and ultimately leads to T2D.CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT02706262, NCT04131166, and NCT01977560.FUNDINGNIH (P30 DK056341, P30 DK020579, and UL1 TR000448); American Diabetes Association (1-18-ICTS-119); Longer Life Foundation; Pershing Square Foundation; and Washington University-Centene ARCH Personalized Medicine Initiative (P19-00559)."

Despite these challenges, since 2020, more than 2,500 peer-reviewed articles have been published on pancreatic islet biology. These include updates on the roles of isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and incretin hormones in insulin secretion, as well as the discovery of inceptor and signalling by circulating RNAs. The year 2020 also brought advancements in in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro models, including a new transgenic mouse for assessing beta-cell proliferation, a \"pancreas-on-a-chip\" to study glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and successful genetic editing of primary human islet cells. Islet biologists evaluated the functionality of stem-cell-derived islet-like cells coated with semipermeable biomaterials to prevent autoimmune attack, revealing the importance of cell maturation after transplantation. Prompted by observations that COVID-19 symptoms can worsen for people with obesity or diabetes, researchers examined how islets are directly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Herein, we highlight novel functional insights, technologies and therapeutic approaches that emerged between March 2020 and July 2021, written for both scientific and lay audiences. We also include a response to these advancements from patient stakeholders, to help lend a broader perspective to developments and challenges in islet research."

This known influence of insulin on satiety encouraged us to investigate the effect of intranasal insulin on feeding-related behaviors. The aim of the current study was to explore the influence of 40 IU of intranasal insulin on the grocery shopping behavior and cookie consumption in a group of 30 healthy young men, using a crossover randomized double-blind design. Using a virtual mock supermarket, we tested whether the intranasal administration of insulin influences purchase behavior in comparison to a placebo or control condition. The participants also provided hedonic ratings of food pictures, as well as their subjective feeling of hunger. We calculated an objective measure of hunger from the amount of cookies eaten. In contradiction to our hypotheses, no significant differences regarding ratings, calorie content of purchased food products, and cookie consumption were found between the treatment conditions. Our conclusion is that 40 IU intranasal insulin had no influence on the evaluation of pictured foods in healthy young men in our task. Acknowledging that previous studies have found effects for intranasal insulin and food cue processing, we suggest that future research should focus on chemosensory stimulation or cognitive tasks in behavioral experiments and carefully consider the doses of intranasal insulin.

Insulin is the drug of choice for gestational and pregestational diabetes. Metabolism of traditional insulins results in inadequate onset and duration of action and marked peak activity. These properties increase risk of excessive glucose excursions, which are especially undesirable during pregnancy. Insulin analogs have been emerging as a safer and more effective treatment of diabetes during pregnancy. Areas covered: This manuscript reviews currently used antihyperglycemic agents: fast and long-acting insulins, metformin and glyburide. Trials demonstrating their efficacy and safety during pregnancy are described. Certain drug metabolism considerations (e.g. affinity to IGF-1) are emphasized. Expert opinion: The theories that insulin analogs bind to immunoglobulin and cross placenta have been disproved. Lispro, aspart, glargine and detemir do not transfer across the placenta and do not result in adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. In addition, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles (rapid onset and 24-hour near peakless activity) substantially reduce blood glucose variability including hypoglycemia. We believe that insulin analogs should be given strong consideration for the treatment of diabetes during pregnancy. Metformin has also proven to be safe and may be considered as an initial single agent for milder gestational diabetes."

Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia remain significant risks due to inaccurate bolus advisor settings and the absence of tracking or an inappropriate handling of bolus on board. This review covers common sources for bolus advisor error such as the selection of physiologically inappropriate bolus advisor settings, the use of short duration of insulin action times, poor algorithm logic that tends to cover all carb intake fully, and an excessive reliance on simplistic dosing algorithms.

Effective use of therapies for this chronic disease is necessary to improve long-term prognosis, but treatment adherence can be difficult to promote in clinical practice, and insulin, in particular, can impact both positively and negatively on patients' quality of life (QoL). Currently, guidelines advocate for QoL as a treatment goal in its own right, with treatment decisions based on patient concerns regarding injection frequency and adverse events, as well as glycemic control. Successful insulin management ideally requires a regimen to replicate normal endogenous insulin release, and this was a key driver in the development of insulin analogs. These analogs have also been associated with lower hypoglycemia risk, lower levels of postprandial glucose excursions, better adherence, improved QoL, and higher patient satisfaction with treatment. Premixed insulin is prescribed for many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), as it combines both prandial and basal treatment, reducing the number of injections. Evidence suggests that premixed insulin analogs have advantages over conventional premixed human insulin for T2D treatment, but the objective of this review was to assess the evidence that switching from a biphasic human insulin to a biphasic insulin analog regimen improves patient QoL."

      "abstract": "Hormones play a crucial role in maintaining the normal human physiology. By acting as chemical messengers that facilitate the communication between different organs, tissues and cells of the body hormones assist in responding appropriately to external and internal stimuli that trigger growth, development and metabolic activities of the body. Any abnormalities in the hormonal composition and balance can lead to devastating health consequences. Hormones have been important therapeutic agents since the early 20th century, when it was realized that their exogenous supply could serve as a functional substitution for those hormones which are not produced enough or are completely lacking, endogenously. Insulin, the pivotal anabolic hormone in the body, was used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder due to the absence or intolerance towards insulin, since 1921 and is the trailblazer in hormone therapeutics. At present the largest market share for therapeutic hormones is held by insulin. Many other hormones were introduced into clinical practice following the success with insulin. However, for the six decades following the introduction the first therapeutic hormone, there was no reliable method for producing human hormones. The most common source for hormones were animals, although semisynthetic and synthetic hormones were also developed. However, none of these were optimal because of their allergenicity, immunogenicity, lack of consistency in purity and most importantly, scalability. The advent of recombinant DNA technology was a game changer for hormone therapeutics. This revolutionary molecular biology tool made it possible to synthesize human hormones in microbial cell factories. The approach allowed for the synthesis of highly pure hormones which were structurally and biochemically identical to the human hormones. Further, the fermentation techniques utilized to produce recombinant hormones were highly scalable. Moreover, by employing tools such as site directed mutagenesis along with recombinant DNA technology, it became possible to amend the molecular structure of the hormones to achieve better efficacy and mimic the exact physiology of the endogenous hormone. The first recombinant hormone to be deployed in clinical practice was insulin. It was called biosynthetic human insulin to reflect the biological route of production. Subsequently, the biochemistry of recombinant insulin was modified using the possibilities of recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering to produce analogues that better mimic physiological insulin. These analogues were tailored to exhibit pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the prandial and basal human insulins to achieve better glycemic control. The present chapter explores the principles of genetic engineering applied to therapeutic hormones by reviewing the evolution of therapeutic insulin and its analogues. It also focuses on how recombinant analogues account for the better management of diabetes mellitus."

The discovery of insulin revolutionized the management of diabetes, the revelation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and introduction of GLP-1 receptor agonists to clinical practice was another breakthrough. Continued translational research resulted in better understanding of diabetes, which, in combination with cutting-edge biology, chemistry, and pharmaceutical tools, have allowed for the development of safer, more effective and convenient insulins and GLP-1. Advances in self-administration of insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist therapies with use of drug-device combination products have further improved the outcomes of diabetes management and quality of life for diabetic patients. The synergies of insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist actions have led to development of devices that can deliver both molecules simultaneously. New chimeric GLP-1-incretins and insulin-GLP-1-incretin molecules are also being developed. The objective of this review is to summarize molecular designs to improve the drug-like properties of insulin and GLP-1 and to highlight the continued advancement of drug-device combination products to improve diabetes management."

      "abstract": "Nearly all health professionals, whatever their practice or speciality, now have contact with a significant number of insulin-using people with diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are nearly universally managed on more complex insulin regimens, increasingly with complex support technology, and with some understanding of the concepts underlying these needed by anyone with responsibility for other aspects of their health care. People with type 2 diabetes usually come to insulin therapy in time, now with a prevalence for insulin administration of \u224850%, thanks to improved management of associated health risks giving longer life expectancy. But while some understandings have simplified the usual approach (basal insulin, self-adjustment dose algorithms), the advent of other medical products offering cardio-renal protection, the use of insulin in combination with these, and the marketing of novel insulin analogues and biosimilars, have all added complexity to clinical decision making. However for the insulin user in the mainstream of care (ambulatory diabetes services in primary and secondary care) the broad principles of choice and management of insulin therapy are fairly easily applied. In the current article, the complexity is dissected and addressed, some of the stigma around insulin therapy is neutralised, and the fundamental approach in regular care drawn into focus. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Insulin therapy is used in their diabetes lifetime by nearly all people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), as well as in all people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). In T2DM this is in the context of the usual progression of islet B-cell secretory failure, but also very often in the context of other conditions, from cancer or steroid therapy to acute arterial events or major surgery. Its prescription in these circumstances means that, in pharmaco-epidemiological studies, insulin use is invariably associated with poor health outcomes, but in a series of major RCTs of 5-15\u2009years duration no excess of vascular or oncological adverse health outcomes was found. Physiologically insulin secretion occurs in two scenarios, namely basal insulin at night and between meals (\u224850%), and in short (\u22484\u2009h) bursts with meals (\u224850%). The former suppresses liver glucose production, which in its absence causes plasma glucose to rise threefold to around 12\u2009mmol/l (but much higher if metabolic stress or with sugar-containing drinks). Meal-time insulin secretion in addition promotes glucose storage in skeletal muscle. People with T1DM, having no endogenous insulin secretion, thus require a multiple injection regimen (basal + meal-time), or pumped insulin, often now moderated by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Basal and meal-time preparations of pharmaceutical insulin analogues are also used for T2DM, with GLP-1RA and metformin usually continued. The starting regimen is normally basal only, usually with insulin glargine (100\u2009U/ml), originator or biosimilar, while insulin degludec or glargine 300\u2009U/ml can have advantage as basal insulins where true 24-h cover is found to be needed. Weekly insulins (developmental or marketed) may have a role in injection acceptability in T2DM, at a cost of some increase in hypoglycaemia. In ambulatory care a meal-time insulin analogue, originator or biosimilar, is added when required, often after some years on basal insulin. Meal insulins are also used in insulin pumps. Hypoglycaemia is a significant issue in T1DM, limiting insulin dosing, but can be helped by CGM, with or without pumps, and careful dose adjustment. It is a much lesser issue in T2DM, until meal-time insulins are introduced, or in people of thinner phenotype, whence again expertise in dose adjustment may be needed. Body weight gain with insulin is usually modest, particularly if basal insulin is begun appropriately before glycosuria has influenced calorie balance. In mainstream ambulatory care the broad principles of insulin therapy are fairly easily applied, the main resources being team familiarity with a basal insulin (glargine/biosimilar), a finger-prick glucose-monitoring system, basic patient education on use of these, and time to supervise dose titration. Beginning with a fixed dose (e.g. 10\u2009U/day) and increasing by 2 U twice a week is simple, but may take months of persistent input to reach target fasting plasma glucose levels. In conclusion, insulin is a usual therapy in both T1DM and T2DM, and in the latter initially at least is fairly easily applied, in combination with other glucose-lowering agents. However it can be more challenging in the context of the technology used in T1DM, once meal-time insulin is added to basal in T2DM, and when dose requirements are complex and unstable in conjunction with other medical conditions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDInsulin is a key regulator of metabolic function. The effects of excess adiposity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis on the complex integration of insulin secretion and hepatic and extrahepatic tissue extraction are not clear.METHODSA hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test were performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity and insulin kinetics after glucose ingestion in 3 groups: (a) lean subjects with normal intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) and glucose tolerance (lean-NL; n = 14), (b) obese subjects with normal IHTG and glucose tolerance (obese-NL; n = 24), and (c) obese subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and prediabetes (obese-NAFLD; n = 22).RESULTSInsulin sensitivity progressively decreased and insulin secretion progressively increased from the lean-NL to the obese-NL to the obese-NAFLD groups. Fractional hepatic insulin extraction progressively decreased from the lean-NL to the obese-NL to the obese-NAFLD groups, whereas total hepatic insulin extraction (molar amount removed) was greater in the obese-NL and obese-NAFLD subjects than in the lean-NL subjects. Insulin appearance in the systemic circulation and extrahepatic insulin extraction progressively increased from the lean-NL to the obese-NL to the obese-NAFLD groups. Total hepatic insulin extraction plateaued at high rates of insulin delivery, whereas the relationship between systemic insulin appearance and total extrahepatic extraction was linear.CONCLUSIONHyperinsulinemia after glucose ingestion in obese-NL and obese-NAFLD is due to an increase in insulin secretion, without a decrease in total hepatic or extrahepatic insulin extraction. However, the liver's maximum capacity to remove insulin is limited because of a saturable extraction process. The increase in insulin delivery to the liver and extrahepatic tissues in obese-NAFLD is unable to compensate for the increase in insulin resistance, resulting in impaired glucose homeostasis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT02706262.FUNDINGNIH grants DK56341 (Nutrition Obesity Research Center), DK052574 (Digestive Disease Research Center), RR024992 (Clinical and Translational Science Award), and T32 DK007120 (a T32 Ruth L.

Published articles were identified on PubMed or within the US Food and Drug Administration submission documents. Overall, 57 articles were identified: 44 assessed hypoglycemic outcomes in participants receiving basal-only therapy (33 in insulin-naive participants; 11 in insulin-experienced participants), 4 in a mixed population (insulin-naive and insulin-experienced participants) and 9 in participants receiving basal-bolus therapy. For the analysis, emphasis was placed on level 2 (blood glucose <3.0\u2009mmol/L (<54 mg/dL)) and level 3 (or severe) hypoglycemia.Overall, event rates for level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia across most studies ranged from 0.06 to 7.10 events/person-year of exposure (PYE) for participants receiving a basal-only insulin regimen; the rate for basal-bolus regimens ranged from 2.4 to 13.6 events/PYE. Rates were generally lower with second-generation basal insulins (insulin degludec or insulin glargine U300) than with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin or first-generation basal insulins (insulin detemir or insulin glargine U100). Subgroup categorization by sulfonylurea usage, end-of-treatment insulin dose or glycated hemoglobin reduction did not show consistent trends on overall hypoglycemia rates. Hypoglycemia rates reported so far for once-weekly basal insulins are consistent with or lower than those reported for daily-administered basal insulin analogs."

      "abstract": "Rapid-acting insulins (RAIs) have been instrumental in the management of diabetes because of their improved postprandial glucose (PPG) control compared with regular human insulin. However, their absorption rate and time action following subcutaneous administration still falls short of the normal physiological response to meal consumption, increasing the risk of early postmeal hyperglycaemia and late postmeal hypoglycaemia. Increased demand for faster acting insulins, which can quickly control PPG excursions without increasing the risk of late hypoglycaemia, led to the development of ultra-rapid-acting insulins, including ultra-rapid lispro (URLi). URLi is a novel formulation of insulin lispro with accelerated absorption driven by two excipients: treprostinil, which increases local vasodilation, and citrate, which increases local vascular permeability. Clinical pharmacology studies consistently showed an earlier onset and shorter duration of action with URLi compared with Lispro. In a head-to-head study with Faster aspart, Aspart and Lispro, URLi was absorbed faster, provided earlier insulin action, and more closely matched physiological glucose response than the other insulins tested. URLi's unique pharmacokinetic properties increase its potential for improved PPG control beyond that achieved with RAIs. Indeed, in pivotal phase 3 trials, URLi was superior to Lispro for PPG control both at 1 and 2\u2009hours after a meal in type 1 and type 2 diabetes with multiple daily injections, and in type 1 diabetes with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. This was achieved without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. In this review, we focus on the clinical and pharmacological evidence for URLi in the treatment of diabetes and discuss the potential benefits and considerations with URLi compared with RAIs."

That insulin signaling is crucial for female reproductive health is clear from clinical data linking hyperinsulinemic and hypoinsulinemic condition with certain types of ovarian dysfunction, such as altered steroidogenesis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and infertility. Thus, understanding the signaling mechanisms that underlie the control of insulin-mediated ovarian development is important for the accurate diagnosis of and intervention for female infertility. Studies of invertebrate and vertebrate model systems have revealed the molecular determinants that transduce insulin signaling as well as which biological processes are regulated by the insulin-signaling pathway. The molecular determinants of the insulin-signaling pathway, from the insulin receptor to its downstream signaling components, are structurally and functionally conserved across evolution, from worms to mammals-yet, physiological differences in signaling still exist. Insulin signaling acts cooperatively with gonadotropins in mammals and lower vertebrates to mediate various aspects of ovarian development, mainly owing to evolution of the endocrine system in vertebrates. In contrast, insulin signaling in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans directly regulates oocyte growth and maturation. In this review, we compare and contrast insulin-mediated regulation of ovarian functions in mammals, lower vertebrates, C. elegans, and Drosophila, and highlight conserved signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms in general while illustrating insulin's unique role in specific reproductive processes."

With the availability of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, basal insulin (BI) therapy is no longer the first-line option after lifestyle modification plus oral agents is insufficient. In contrast to BI, the newer medications require minor titration, lower hyperglycemia in a glucose-dependent manner, and reduce body weight. Importantly, the newer agents reduce cardiorenal events in the short term. Nonetheless, insulin therapy continues to play a key role in control of hyperglycemia and therefore long-term prevention of vascular complications. Its use is essential in many circumstances, including metabolic emergencies, new diabetes onset, latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA), pregnancy, and when other agents are less desirable due to comorbidities. BI is needed in the frequent condition of failure of other therapies to keep HbA1c to target and/or intolerance of them. There are several advantages to the combination of BI with the newer medications given their different but complementary mechanisms of action, primarily, the lower dose of each, improving adherence and outcomes while decreasing the side effects. Multiple choices for single or combination use can better meet the variety of clinical phenotypes in the heterogeneous T2DM population, using the tenets of precision medicine."

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 24 patients with diagnosis of MetS according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were evaluated. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin concentrations were measured every 30\u2009min during 2\u2009h after a 75-g dextrose load.

      "abstract": "Escalating insulin prices have prompted public scrutiny of the practices of drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, health insurers, and pharmacies involved in production and distribution of medications. As a result, a series of policies have been proposed or enacted to improve insulin affordability and foster greater equity in access. These policies have implications for other diabetes and obesity therapeutics. Recent legislation, at both the state and federal level, has capped insulin out-of-pocket payments for some patients. Other legislation has targeted drug manufacturers directly in requiring rebates on drugs with price increases beyond inflation rates, an approach that may restrain price hikes for existing medications. In addition, government negotiation of drug pricing, a contentious issue, has gained traction, with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 permitting limited negotiation for certain high expenditure drugs without generic or biosimilar competition, including some insulin products and other diabetes medications. However, concerns persist that this may inadvertently encourage higher launch prices for new medications. Addressing barriers to competition has also been a priority such as through increased enforcement against anticompetitive practices (e.g., \"product hopping\") and reduced regulatory requirements for biosimilar development and market entry. A novel approach involves public production, exemplified by California's CalRx program, which aims to provide biosimilar insulins at significantly reduced prices. Achieving affordable and equitable access to insulin and other diabetes and obesity medications requires a multifaceted approach, involving state and federal intervention, ongoing policy evaluation and refinement, and critical examination of corporate influences in health care."

      "abstract": "Diabetes during pregnancy has been linked to unfavorable maternal-fetal outcomes. Human insulins are the first drug of choice because of the proven safety in their use. However, there are still questions about the use of insulin analogs during pregnancy. The objective of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of insulin analogs compared with human insulin in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes through a systematic review with meta-analysis. The search comprised the period since the inception of each database until July 2017, and the following databases were used: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, LILACS, Scopus, SIGLE and Google Scholar. We have selected 29 original articles: 11 were randomized clinical trials and 18 were observational studies. We have explored data from 6,382 participants. All of the articles were classified as having an intermediate to high risk of bias. The variable that showed favorable results for the use of insulin analogs was gestational age, with a mean difference of - 0.26 (95\u2009% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.49; p =\u20090.02), but with significant heterogeneity (Higgins test [I 2 ]\u2009=\u200938%; chi-squared test [\u03c7 2 ]\u2009=\u200916.24; degree of freedom [DF]\u2009=\u200910; p =\u20090.09). This result, in the clinical practice, does not compromise the fetal well-being, since all babies were born at term. There was publication bias in the gestational age and neonatal weight variables. To date, the evidence analyzed has a moderate-to-high risk of bias and does not allow the conclusion that insulin analogs are more effective when compared with human insulin to treat diabetic pregnant women."

Thus, DM was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) (60\u2009mg/kg). Subsequently, the rats were treated with PBM (808\u2009nm and 30\u2009J/cm 2 ). After euthanasia, morphometric parameters and immunoreactivity for insulin and 8-OHdG were evaluated in the pancreas. The results showed that treated animals had higher values of body mass and higher values in the number of beta cells in the pancreas. In conclusion, PBM resulted in decreased weight loss in STZ-induced diabetic rats and presented a stimulatory effect on the pancreas of the treated animals, highlighting the promising effects of this therapy in the clinical condition of DM."

Management and treatment are aimed to achieve best possible glycemic control, while avoiding hypoglycemia and ensuring maternal and fetal safety. It involves behavioral modifications, nutrition and medications, if needed; concurrent with maternal and fetal surveillance for possible adverse outcomes. This review aims to elaborate on the pharmacological options for GDM therapy. We performed an extensive literature review of different available studies, published during the last 50\u00a0years, concerning pharmacological therapy for GDM, dealing with safety and efficacy, for both fetal and maternal morbidity consequences; as well as failure and success in establishing appropriate metabolic and glucose control. Oral medication therapy is a safe and effective treatment modality for GDM and in some circumstances may serve as first-line therapy when nutritional modifications fail. When oral agents fail to establish glucose control then insulin injections should be added. Determining the best oral therapy in inconclusive, although it seems that metformin is slightly superior to glyburide, in some aspects. As for parenteral therapy, all insulins listed in this article are considered both safe and effective for treatment of hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Importantly, a better safety profile, with similar efficacy is documented for most analogues. As GDM prevalence rises, there is a need for successful monitoring and treatment for patients. Caregivers should know the possible and available therapeutic options."

Poor peripheral insulin sensitivity as quantified by HOMA-IR in baseline condition and increases in systemic insulin levels reactive to intranasal administration predicted poor olfactory performance. In contrast, intranasal insulin enhanced odor perception with a dose-dependent improvement of olfactory threshold. These findings indicate a new diametric impact of insulin on olfactory perception depending on peripheral or central availability."

It would be highly desirable to standardize data presentations to avoid the chaotic emergence of multiple formats that might reduce the clinical utility of connected pens. Methods: We reviewed the literature and analyzed data displays from multiple blood glucose monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin pump, and automated insulin delivery systems, and methods for combination of glucose and insulin data. We examined multiple forms of presentation and now propose a prototype for a standardized method for data analysis and display, focusing on the content and format of a one-page dashboard summary for patients on multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin regimens. Results: We propose the following metrics to be included in the one-page report: (A) glucose metrics: simplified glucose distribution in the form of a stacked bar chart showing percentages of time below-, above-, or within-target ranges overall and (optionally) by date, by time of day, or day of the week; (B) insulin metrics: types and doses, and timing of basal and bolus insulin; (C) an enhanced ambulatory glucose profile or \"AGP+\" showing glucose data points and/or distributions (10th to 90th percentiles), dosages and timing of basal and bolus insulins and (optionally) graphical display of risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and (D) user experience regarding technology usage, frequency of alerts for hypo- and hyperglycemia, and information regarding lifestyle, meals, exercise, and sleep, if available; and (E) clinical insights and interpretation. Conclusion: We propose a prototype for a dashboard summary report of glucose, insulin, meals, and activity data intended for providers and patients on MDI using connected pens and CGM. Our goal is to stimulate development of a standardized approach."

The clinical spin off was immediate as well as the internationalization of insulin's commercial production. The outcomes regarding basic research were much slower, in particular regarding the molecular mechanisms of insulin action on its target cells. It took almost a half-century before the determination of the tri-dimensional structure of insulin in 1969 and the characterization of its cell receptor in 1970-1971. The demonstration that the insulin receptor is in fact an enzyme named tyrosine kinase came in the years 1982-1985, and the crystal structure of the intracellular kinase domain 10 years later. The crystal structure of the first intracellular kinase substrate (IRS-1) in 1991 paved the way for the elucidation of the intracellular signalling pathways but it took 15 more years to obtain the complete crystal structure of the extracellular receptor domain (without insulin) in 2006. Since then, the determination of the structure of the whole insulin-receptor complex in both the inactive and activated states has made considerable progress, not least due to recent improvement in the resolution power of cryo-electron microscopy. I will here review the steps in the development of the concept of hormone receptor, and of our knowledge of the structure and molecular mechanism of activation of the insulin receptor."

Three programmed warming cycles to 40\u00b0C within 50 minutes are resulting in faster insulin appearance in the plasma. Early standardized meal tolerance studies indicated a substantial improvement in postprandial glucose control when the same short-acting insulin analog dose was applied using InsuPad, and a dose reduction by 20% resulted in comparable glucose excursions. Similar results were obtained when patients applied the device under real-world conditions for 1 month. The InsuPad device was also tested in a prospective, controlled, parallel 3-month real-world study with 145 well-controlled but insulin-resistant patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Patients were treated to target in both treatment arms (6.2 \u00b1 0.5% in each group), with or without the device. However, patients with InsuPad needed 28% less prandial insulin, needed 12.5% less total insulin, and had 46% less confirmed hypoglycemic events (blood glucose < 63 mg/dL) as compared to the control group. Except for very few inflammatory or allergic skin reactions, there were no device-specific adverse events reported from these studies. In conclusion, use of InsuPad when applying prandial insulin doses may result in a safer and more efficient treatment of type 1 or type 2 diabetes."

This article includes a thorough review of insulin icodec's safety and efficacy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus including its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. A systematic search of the electronic database of PubMed from inception until December 2024 using MeSH keywords was completed. Keywords used were icodec, insulin, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Overall, 14 clinical trials were identified and reviewed. The majority of the trials reviewed showed decreases in A1C as primary endpoints and non-inferiority and superiority with insulin icodec versus the comparator. In select studies, mild hypoglycemia was more evident in subjects taking insulin icodec versus the comparator but no other concerns were identified. The reviewed literature showed similar and sometimes improved glycemic control when insulin icodec was compared to other long-acting insulins both in insulin-naive and previously insulin-treated patients. Hypoglycemia was similar or slightly increased with insulin icodec when compared to other long acting insulins. Overall, icodec is a useful, new formulation of basal insulin that allows for less injections, improved compliance, and potentially improved glycemic control providing a new tool to practitioners managing patients with diabetes who need to be on insulin."

The contribution of anthropometric characteristics, peripheral, and hepatic insulin action to this variability was also examined. To do so, we studied 54 nondiabetic subjects on two occasions in which endogenous hormone secretion was inhibited by somatostatin, with glucagon infused at a rate of 0.65 ng/kg/min, at 0 min to prevent a fall in glucagon (nonsuppressed day) or at 120 min to create a transient fall in glucagon (suppressed day). Subjects received glucose (labeled with [3- 3 H]-glucose) infused to mimic the systemic appearance of 50-g oral glucose. Insulin was infused to mimic a prandial insulin response in 18 subjects, another 18 received 80% of the dose, and the remaining 18 received 60%. EGP was measured using the tracer-dilution technique. Decreased prandial insulin resulted in greater % increase in peak glucose but not in integrated glucose concentrations attributable to nonsuppressed glucagon. The % change in integrated EGP was unaffected by insulin dose. Multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, weight, and insulin dose, did not show a relationship between the EGP response to impaired suppression of glucagon and insulin action as measured at the time of screening by oral glucose tolerance. A similar analysis for hepatic insulin action also did not show a relationship with the EGP response. These data indicate that the effect of impaired glucagon suppression on EGP is independent of anthropometric characteristics and insulin action. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In prediabetes, anthropometric characteristics as well as insulin action do not alter the hepatic response to glucagon. The postprandial suppression or lack of suppression of glucagon secretion is an important factor governing postprandial glucose tolerance independent of insulin secretion."

In January 2006, Pfizer secured FDA and EC approval for the first of its kind, regular insulin through Exubera inhaler device for the management of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in adults. The product was no longer available to the market after less than two years from its approval triggering a setback for competitive new inhalable insulins that were already in various clinical development phases. In contrary, MannKind Corporation started developing its ultra-rapid-acting insulin Afrezza in a bold bid, probably by managing the issues in which Exubera was not successful. Afrezza has been marketed since February, 2015 by Sanofi after getting FDA approval in June 2014. The results from this systematic review indicate the effectiveness of insulin inhalation products, particularly for patients initiating insulin therapy. Pharmaceutical companies should capitalize on the information available from insulin inhalation to produce competitive products that are able to match the bioavailability of subcutaneous (SC) insulin injection and to deal with the single insulin unit increments and basal insulin requirements in some diabetic patients or extending the horizon to inhalable drug products with completely different drug entities for other indications."

These numerous novel peptide toxins are a valuable resource for future marine drug development. In this review, we compared and analyzed the sequence diversity, three-dimensional structural variations, and evolutionary aspects of venom insulin derived from different cone snail species. The comparative analysis reveals that there are significant variations in the sequences and three-dimensional structures of venom insulins from cone snails with different feeding habits. Notably, the venom insulin of some piscivorous cone snails exhibits a greater similarity to humans and zebrafish insulins. It is important to emphasize that these venom insulins play a crucial role in the predatory strategies of these cone snails. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to trace the lineage of venom insulin sequences, shedding light on the evolutionary interconnections among cone snails with diverse diets."

      "abstract": "Hypoglycaemia is a common side-effect of diabetes therapies, particularly insulin, and imposes a substantial burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Consequently, regulatory approval of newer basal insulin (BI) therapies has relied on demonstration of a balance between achievement of good glycaemic control and less hypoglycaemia. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for assessing efficacy and safety, including hypoglycaemia risk, of BIs and are invaluable for obtaining regulatory approval. However, their highly selected patient populations and their conditions lead to results that may not be representative of real-life situations. Real-world evidence (RWE) studies are more representative of clinical practice, but they also have limitations. As such, data both from RCTs and RWE studies provide a fuller picture of the hypoglycaemia risk with BI therapies. However, substantial differences exist in the way hypoglycaemia is reported across these studies, which confounds comparisons of hypoglycaemia frequency among different BIs. This problem is ongoing and persists in recent trials of second-generation BI analogues. Although they provide a lower risk of hypoglycaemia when compared with earlier BIs, they do not eliminate it. This review describes differences in the way hypoglycaemia is reported across RCTs and RWE studies of second-generation BI analogues and examines potential reasons for these differences. For studies of BIs, there is a need to standardize aspects of design, analysis and methods of reporting to better enable interpretation of the efficacy and safety of such insulins among studies; such aspects include length of follow-up, glycaemic targets, hypoglycaemia definitions and time intervals for determining nocturnal events."

Hypoglycaemia remains a major limiting factor to successful glycaemic management, despite the availability of prevention options such as insulin analogues, continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pumps, and dogs that have been trained to detect hypoglycaemia. Non-severe (self-treated) and severe (requiring assistance for recovery) hypoglycaemia rates are higher in people with type 1 diabetes, but those with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes are also at risk. Education and regular review are essential between people with diabetes and their caregivers and healthcare professionals about symptoms, prevention and treatment. Awareness of the potential dangers of hypoglycaemia is fundamental to the optimal management of diabetes. When therapy is intensified to achieve glycaemic targets, it is important that people at risk of severe hypoglycaemia, and particularly their caregivers, have ready access to effective treatment for hypoglycaemia emergencies. The current and potential formulations of glucagon available for treatment of severe hypoglycaemia are reviewed."

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\nThere is general agreement that statin-treatment of patients to lower plasma cholesterol levels can increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in some individuals1-5. The physiologic mechanism for the increased risk for T2D from statin treatment is unknown but could result from effects on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. This study will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in non-diabetic individuals in regards to its effect on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to help further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrence of T2D in people who are at risk for T2D. This research study will also examine what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2D.\n\nThe goals of this study are to:\n\n1. determine the effect of high-intensity atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for \\~ 10 weeks on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (defined with gold standard methods) (PRIMARY OUTCOMES) as well as other glycemic traits (SECONDARY OUTCOMES);\n2. compare a number of cardio-metabolic characteristics (e.g. weight, lipids) before, during, and after administration of atorvastatin;\n3. determine if significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion following statin treatment will be confined to those with baseline insulin resistance (PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUP ANALYSES);\n4. perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) 6,7 before and after taking atorvastatin to examine treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables and to analyze not only previously-known drug efficacy but also untargeted drug efficacy (EXPLORATORY ANALYSES).\n\nGeneral approach:\n\nThis will be an open-label study to evaluate the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin (40 mg/day for 10 weeks) on both insulin action and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. To ensure we recruit individuals across a broad range of insulin sensitivity, we will target recruitment to enrich for those with combined increases in LDL-C and TG concentrations (see SIGNIFICANCE and RATIONALE). The experimental population will consist of \\~75 apparently healthy, non-diabetic volunteers eligible for statin therapy but without pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Following baseline assessments of co-primary outcome measures: insulin sensitivity (by insulin suppression test, IST) and insulin secretion (by graded glucose infusion test, GGIT), participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet and treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. All baseline measurements will be repeated \\~10 weeks later with iPOP8 measurements done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, and 10 on atorvastatin, and at weeks 4 and 8 off atorvastatin.",
      "detailed_description": "1. SIGNIFICANCE\n\n   Statins and the risk of T2D: Statin treatment is associated with an increase in incident T2D.1-4 5\n\n   Mechanism of statin-induced T2D: It is unclear whether statins increase the risk of T2D by decreasing insulin action, secretion, or both. Several manuscripts have been published that substantially increase understanding of the link between statin use and incident T2D. Swerdlow, et al.2 based on evidence from genetic analysis and randomized trials, concluded that the increased risk of T2D noted with statins is at least \"partially explained by HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibition.\" They also noted an association of weight gain with HMGCR variants in statin-treated patients, leading to the notion that decreases in insulin sensitivity contribute to statin-induced diabetes. In that context, Cederberg, at al.9 have shown in a large prospective study (n=8749 men) that participants treated with statins (n=2142) had a 46% increase in incident T2D, associated with a 24% decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 12% decrease in insulin secretion assessed by surrogate measures.\n\n   Identifying those with at enhanced risk of statin-induced T2D: Studies of 3 randomized clinical trials with atorvastatin by David Waters' group 1,3,4 have demonstrated that \"baseline fasting glucose, body mass index, hypertension, and fasting triglycerides were independent predictors of T2D.\" These abnormalities form a cluster attributed to insulin resistance.10 Since insulin resistance is a predictor of developing T2D, it seems likely that the more insulin resistant the individuals are before treatment, the greater is their risk to for statin-induced T2D.\n\n   In that context, relatively little attention has been given to the role that metabolic heterogeneity in patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations might play in statin-induced T2D. Specifically, subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations, whose plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are also elevated, are insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant as compared to those with isolated LDL-C levels. As such, this subset of patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations can be viewed as being at a \"tipping point,\" and any adverse effect of statins on insulin action and/or secretion, irrespective of how mediated, places them at enhanced risk to develop statin-induced diabetes. Indeed, we have shown (Kohli et al)1 that patients with both insulin resistance (as estimated by high TGs) and prediabetes are at particularly high risk of statin-induced T2D.\n\n   We seek to address 2 important unanswered questions: Do statins primarily affect insulin resistance or insulin secretion?; Are there subsets of individuals at highest risk of statin-induced T2D?\n2. RATIONALE, HYPOTHESIS\n\n   Rationale:\n\n   T2D develops when insulin resistant individuals cannot maintain the degree of compensatory hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. However, significant fundamental questions remain. For example, what is the cellular/molecular link between statin treatment and changes in insulin action and secretion?\n\n   This proposal is based on the premise that studying the effect of statins on insulin action and insulin secretion using \"gold standard\" methods will help determine if statins adversely affect the risk of T2D by increasing insulin resistance or decreasing insulin secretion. We use the insulin suppression test (with the read-out of steady-state plasma glucose, SSPG) to ascertain insulin sensitivity and the graded glucose infusion test (with the readout of insulin secretion rate, ISR) to ascertain insulin secretion both before and after statin treatment in non-diabetic individuals.\n\n   We hypothesize that treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. Thus, we plan to look at the effect of atorvastatin not only in all participants but also in subsets of individuals with baseline insulin resistance (which will be enriched for by recruiting volunteers with elevated plasma TG levels (\u2265150 mg/dL) at baseline. The rationale for this is that plasma TGs are a surrogate measure for insulin resistance with a modest correlation with the direct measure of insulin resistance (steady-state plasma glucose) measured by the insulin suppression test. Clinically, subjects with elevated TGs prior to statin treatment would have substantial clinical benefit from statins, and one of investigators' secondary goals is to demonstrate that a simple measurement of plasma TG concentration (as a surrogate for insulin resistance) can help identify those most at risk of statin induced derangements in glycemic control. Consequently, we propose to enroll nondiabetic volunteers at high-risk for T2D, free of known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), not receiving statins, eligible for statin therapy according to ACC/AHA (American College for Cardiology/American Heart Association) 2013 guidelines.11 We will also target recruitment efforts to enrich for subjects with plasma TG concentration \u2265 150 mg/dL to ensure that we enroll subjects across the range of insulin sensitivity.\n\n   Hypothesis: We hypothesize that high intensity atorvastatin treatment for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance.\n3. STUDY DESIGN\n\n   Sample Size\n\n   \u2022 We aim to recruit and retain 75 total participants in this study.\n\n   Study Location\n\n   \u2022 Clinical and Translational Research Unit (CTRU) at 800 Welch Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304.\n\n   Duration\n\n   \u2022 We anticipate that the entire study will take 4 - 5 years through the end of data analysis. Each eligible candidate who voluntarily consents to participate in the study will be active in the study for a total of 5 months from screening to the end of their last visit.\n4. STUDY PROCEDURES\n\n   Recruitment\n\n   Preliminary recruitment strategies will include:\n\n   Volunteers will be recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area through advertisements in newspapers, posted flyers, and the social networking site NextDoor as well as from the Preventive Cardiology Clinics at Stanford Health Care. Our goal is to ensure recruitment across a broad range of insulin sensitivity. Prior work from our group and others has shown that high plasma TG concentrations are associated with increased insulin resistance as assessed by reference measures. Therefore, we will target advertisements to enrich for individuals with high TG levels (\\> 150 mg/dL) as a surrogate for increased insulin resistance.\n\n   Participant Visits and Procedures\n\n   Potential participants will be screened initially when they call or email in response to recruitment ads, or a letter from their MD, describing the study as follows:\n\n   Preliminary intake will occur over the phone.\n\n   Visit 1 Screening visit.\n\n   Visit 2: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): This test will take approximately 3 hours.\n\n   i) Glycemic status: Participants will be classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or combined IFG/IGT12. In addition, the total integrated plasma glucose response during the OGTT will be calculated by the trapezoidal method (Glucose-AUC).\n\n   ii) \u03b2-cell function: Calculations of the Insulin Secretion- Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) will be used to quantify insulin secretory function 13, if for some reason a graded glucose infusion study is not done. The ISSI-2 is a validated OGTT- derived method to measure of \u03b2-cell function, analogous to the disposition index obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test 14. It is calculated by multiplying the insulin secretory response during the OGTT (Insulin-AUC/Glucose-AUC) by insulin resistance (Matsuda index).\n\n   The fasting and 2-hour glucose results will be discussed with the study participant and a copy of the results will be given to them.\n\n   Visit 3. Graded Glucose Infusion, GGIT 15,16: This test will take approximately 6 hours.\n\n   This test is designed to assess the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin in response to a graded glucose infusion. During this test, subjects will have two small IV catheters placed, one in each arm. One IV will be used for drawing samples and the other for the infusion of glucose. During the GGIT, continuous intravenous infusions of glucose will be given at progressively increasing rates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 kg/min in six infusion periods of 40-min duration. Blood samples will be collected for measurements of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations at fasting and at 30 min and 40 min into each infusion period. The two values during the last 10 min of each infusion period will be averaged. The amount of blood taken for this test will 47.5 ml.\n\n   Visit 4.Insulin Suppression test, IST 17,18: This test will take approximately 6 hours.\n\n   This test is designed to determine whole body insulin sensitivity. Following an overnight fast, subjects will have an IV placed in each arm. One for collection of blood and the other for infusion with octreotide (0.27 \u03bcg/m2/min), insulin (32 mU/m2/min), and glucose (267 mg/m2/min) for 180 minutes. During the test, endogenous insulin is suppressed and all individuals are given the same concentration of insulin, based on their body surface area. Blood is drawn every 30 minutes for 150 minutes and then at 10-minute intervals from 150 to 180 minutes of the infusion to measure plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. The mean of the last four values is used as the steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) and glucose (SSPG) concentrations for each individual. As SSPI concentrations are similar in all subjects during the IST, the SSPG concentration provides a direct measure of the ability of insulin to mediate disposal of an infused glucose load; the higher the SSPG concentration, the more insulin resistant the individual. Labs to check kidney and liver function plus a lipid panel and a urine pregnancy test (if appropriate) will be done at this visit. Blood drawn or IST will be 58.5 ml and 5 ml for SHC labs.\n\n   Labs for iPOP will be drawn at this time and additional samples will be obtained for transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome, and proteome analysis in blood; nasal, tongue, skin surface swabs; urine; and stool.\n\n   The study drug, atorvastatin 40 mg will be given to study participants, once all labs have been reviewed and participant qualifies.\n\n   Visit 5-7: Visits will be every 2 weeks for a total of 10 weeks on study medication (statin). Participants will be assessed for any side effects or adverse events (AE) on the statin. Adherence to study medication will be assessed at each visit.\n\n   Visit 8: Weight, vital signs, and OGTT described above.\n\n   Visit 9: Repeat GGIT as described above.\n\n   Visit 10: Repeat IST and iPOP lab testing and samples as described above. At the end of this visit, the statin will be stopped and the study participant would be scheduled for 4- and 8-week follow up visits.\n\n   Visit 11: One month off statin study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.\n\n   Visit 12: Last study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.\n\n   Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaire about her/his physical activity status, food and eating habits, and stress at the time of each iPOP.\n5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nBased on our prior work19, we calculated that with 60 subjects, we would be able to detect an 8% change in SSPG concentration and an 8% change in ISRAUC after atorvastatin therapy with 80% power and two-side significance level of 5% using a paired samples t test. Thus, we estimated needing to enroll 75 subjects with an anticipated a dropout rate of 20%.\n\nSummary statistics will be reported as median (interquartile range) or number (percent) of participants unless otherwise specified. Shapiro-Wilk tests will be used to assess normality of data, and variables that are not normally distributed will be log-transformed. Percent changes in variables will be calculated by the formula: \\[(end-of study value) - (baseline value) / baseline value\\] x 100. Paired samples t tests will be used to compare baseline and end-of-study means. One sample t tests will be employed to evaluate whether percent changes in variables are significantly different from zero (no change). Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to determine the strength of association between variables of interest. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be carried out by stratifying for insulin resistant versus insulin sensitive subjects. The SSPG concentration median will be used to define subjects as being insulin resistant or insulin sensitive. Insulin resistant and insulin sensitive group means will be compared by independent sample t tests and proportions by chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Statistical analyses will be performed by using statistical software IBM SPSS version 26.0.",

As a secondary endpoints the investigators will determine the effect of intensive insulin therapy on organ dysfunction and mortality of these patients.",
      "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe treatment of the sepsis can be done at three different level:\n\n1. Etiologic therapy. The eradication of the infectious agent is the primary end-point. An appropriate surgical treatment and antibiotic therapy are the key of the etiologic therapy.\n2. Symptomatic therapy. It is the traditional approach in the Intensive Care Unit. It involves to correct the symptomatic issues that can lead to the death of the patients, buying the time necessary for the action of the etiologic and the pathogenic therapy. The key point of the symptomatic therapy are: a) an adequate expansion of the volemia and the use of cardiovascular-acting drugs, for the maintenance of an adequate cardiocirculatory homeostasis. Recently it has been demonstrated that an early aggressive haemodynamic therapy direct to maintain a mixed venous Oxygen Saturation above 70% improved the mortality compared with a standard approach (3); b) apply a mechanical ventilation adequate for the maintenance of the respiratory homeostasis. In fact it has been recently shown an increased survival rate in patients treated with low tidal volume ventilation strategy compared to standard strategy.\n3. Pathogenic therapy. It consists to block the inflammatory and/or coagulation pathway at different level. In the last 30 years a number of report studied different approach (anti-endotoxin antibodies, anti-TNF antibodies, anti-IL6 antibodies, treatment with high doses of corticosteroid, etc.). While all these approaches showed an efficacy in experimental settings when given preventively, most of them have no effect in phase 3 clinical trial. This discrepancy may be explained considering: 1) the system can be considered chaotic, with riddance and interdependency of the response; 2) in the clinical studies the treatment was applied after the development of the sepsis, when the inflammatory and coagulation systems are still largely activated.\n\nThree study has recently demonstrated a benefit in survival:\n\n1. The treatment with low-dosage corticosteroids in patients non-responders to ACH stimulation test (5). This is a substitutive therapy. It is important to note that the treatment with high dosage corticosteroids to block completely the inflammatory response is not effective (6).\n2. The treatment with recombinant activated Protein C (7) did increased the relative survival rate by 20%. Of note the activated Protein C is the only molecule with three main mechanisms of action: anticoagulatory, antiinflammatory and profibrinolytic.\n3. In a recent study in post-surgical patients it has been shown a significant improvement in survival in patients treated with a a tight glycemic control within 80 and 110 mg/dL compared to those in which the glycemia was corrected only when reaching higher level (\\>215 mg/dL) (8).We still lack a definitive explanation for these findings, and the discussion is mainly on the relative roles of glycemia per se versus insulin therapy per se.\n\nHowever, looking at the overall scenario, some issues are of note:\n\n1. We know that a complete block of the inflammatory reaction or a complete block of the coagulation cascade do not improve outcome in septic patients\n2. The activated Protein C is the molecule with the highest spectrum of action, in particular is the only molecule within the numerous molecules tested with pro-fibrinolytic activity\n3. We know that higher glycemia per se does greatly increase the PAI production (the molecule which inhibits the fibrinolysis).\n4. The septic patients primarily die because of multiple organ dysfunction which is in part due to a widespread microthrombosis.\n\nA possible unifying hypothesis is that the improved outcome observed with activate Protein C and with the tight glycemic control is due to the maintenance of a physiologic fibrinolysis. This hypothesis has never been tested and if proved could open interesting therapeutical approaches in the septic patients exposed to the high mortality risk.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The primary end-point is the evaluation of the activation/deactivation of the fibrinolytic system in the two-randomization groups.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: This study is a multicenter, randomized, Phase 2/3 study of adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. We will enroll a total of approximately 80 adult patients.\n\nTREATMENTS ADMINISTERED\n\n1. Control: glycemia will be controlled with insulin administration when higher than 215 mg/dL.\n2. Treatment: glycemia will be controlled with be controlled with insulin administration when higher than 110 mg/dL.\n\nRANDOMIZATION: The patients enrolled will undergo a block-randomization by center in two arms and stratified according to the clinical decision of the caring physician to use or not use the activated Protein C.\n\nDATA COLLECTION: The clinical variables and the biochemical variables of fibrinolysis, coagulation, contact phase and pro-inflammatory cytokines will be recorded daily for the first 7 days, each second day until the 14 days and the each fifth until the end of the study (28th day, or dimission/death if before).\n\nAt Baseline:Demographic data\n\nEvery 24 hours:\n\n1. Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) (9). The Simplified Acute Physiology Score assesses the severity of illness on the basis of 12 physiological variables; age, the type of admission (urgent or nonurgent) and 3 variables related to the underlying disease. Scores can range from 0 to 194; higher scores are correlated with a higher risk of death during hospitalization\n2. SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) (10). It is an index of multi-organ dysfunction (range 0-24).\n3. Ramsey scale (11). It is an index of level of sedation (range 1-6).\n4. Respiratory, circulatory and biochemical of variables for monitoring the organs dysfunction (4).\n\nThe main biochemical variables collected are:\n\n* Fibrinolytic system:\n\n  1. PAI-1 activity\n  2. PAI- 1 antigen\n  3. tPA antigen\n  4. Plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP)\n  5. D-Dimer fragment\n  6. Polymorphism 4G/5 of the PAI-1 gene\n* Final phase pf the coagulation pathway\n\n  1. Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT)\n  2. Prothrombin fragment F1 + 2\n* Contact system\n\n  1. Activated Factor XII (FXIIa)\n  2. Metabolism of endogenous bradykinin\n  3. Polymorphism insertion/deletion of the gene of angiotensin converting enzyme\n* Inflammation\n\n  1. C reactive protein (CRP)\n  2. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)\n  3. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\n  4. C3a\n  5. SC5b-9\n\nSAFETY ASPECTS AND SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) REPORTING: GCP rules will be strictly applied, including timely reporting to the study coordination within 48 hours from their occurrence of the SAEs not included in the efficacy end-points. Clinical investigators and nurses of each of the participating centers will be instructed to monitor specifically and to document the adverse events more likely to be associated with the study treatment.\n\nSTATISTICAL ASPECTS: we plan to enroll 80 septic patients in the ICU related with the participating research units. This size will allow showing an average difference of 30% of fibrinolysis biochemical parameters (alfa = 0.05, 1-beta = 0.80).\n\nADMINISTRATIVE, LEGAL, ETHICAL ISSUES: This study is designed by our collaborative group, which has been active over the last ten years in conducting clinical trials in intensive care. The study has been planned and is managed independently, and the clinicians who take active part in the study do not receive economic incentives. The Ely Lilly Italia Spa will provide a financial support for performing the laboratory tests required in studying the fibrinolysis. It is important to emphasize that we are comparing the effects of two different strategies of glycemic control on the fibrinolysis. The Ely Lilly interest in the study is only scientific, as, if we could show the importance of the fibrinolysis in sepsis, this could elucidate one of the putative mechanisms of activated Protein C action. This study is also partially funded by a grant of the Ministry of University and research (COFIN 2004).\n\nThe data which are produced belong to the study group, who ensures their publication and their availability for public authorities.\n\nAll data related to the patients included in the study are treated in strict compliance with the Italian Laws related to privacy 675/1996.\n\nThe informed consent for the patients will be administered as soon as and every time the clinical conditions of the same patients are compatible with the procedure, thus following the provisions set forth by the ICH-GCP guidelines (13), and confirmed by the most recent European Directive 2001/20/CE Decreto Legislativo 211 24/06/2003. It is worth recalling that there is no legal basis for requiring the consent to a relative of the patient.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

      "brief_summary": "Diabetes is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, cancer and premature death. One in 10 adults are affected by diabetes. Early control of high blood gluocse prevents progressive deterioration and treatment escalation. People with diabetes have impaired insulin secretion, the only hormone that can lower blood glucose, or resistance to insulin action. There are trillions of microrganisms (tiny living things including bacteria) in the gut that can interact with foods and medicine to alter bodily functions including insulin secretion and its actions. Studies in animals and human suggested that a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) containing a combination of four herbs (Jinmai, abbreviated as JM) reduced blood glucose by increasing insulin secretion accompanied by favorable changes in gut bacteria and expression of genetic information that regulate bodily functions.\n\nIn this study, people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for less than 6 years and not treated with any glucose lowering drugs are assigned randomly to recieve 1) high dose JM (JM-HD) or 2) low dose JM (JM-LD) or 3) look-alike dummy (placebo) given in powder form to be dissolved in water taken twice daily for 24 weeks. We shall compare the abilities of these 3 combination products to lower blood glucose over a 2-hour period after taking a nutritional drink at 0, 12 and 24 weeks. The assigned treatment will then be discontinued for 12 weeks and the test will be repeated to see if improvement is sustained. Samples will be collected at week 0 and 24 (on-treatment) and week 36 (12 weeks off-treament) to compare changes in gut bacteria in faeces and expression of genetic information that make proteins which regulate blood glucose amongst these 3 groups.",
      "detailed_description": "People with impaired insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells is the main cause of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This can be demonstrated by measuring insulin secretion following an 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Other pathophysiological processes underlying diabetes include non-suppression of glucagon from pancreatic alpha-cells with increased fasting blood glucose, abnormal incretin (e.g. glucagon like peptide GLP1) secretion from gut which augment insulin secretion during food intake as well as changes in gut microbiota which can interact with foods and medicine to alter hormonal secretion and metabolic milieu. Obesity, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidemia can alter inflammatory pathways, transcription factors and oxidative stress resulting in further impairment of insulin secretion and its actions. Early attainment of glycemic control can break these vicious cycles, improve glycemic durability and reduce progressive treatment escalation.\n\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses indicate that TCM containing multiple active components may prevent and control diabetes in human. In animal studies, our group first reported that a combination of extracts from 3 herbs (Coptidis Rhizoma; Astragali Radix; Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, abbreviated as CAL) lowered blood glucose in diabetic rats with sustained improvement in insulin resistance and beta-cell function accompanied by resolution of fatty liver. These effects persisted for weeks or months after treatment discontinuation depending on treatment duration. These improvements were accompanied by changes in gene expression (RNA and microRNA) implicated in energy metabolism. In another animal study, we first reported that extracts from Ophiopogonis (Oph) increased insulin secretion, reduced inflammation and expanded islet mass with lowering of blood glucose.\n\nBased on these mechanistic studies, we designed a proprietary formula consisting of CAL plus Oph (referred as Jinmai, JM). We randomized people with prediabetes to recieve 12-week treatment with 1) CAL only, 2) CAL+Oph low dose (JM-LD), 3) CAL+Oph very low dose (JM-VLD) and 4) consultation with CM practitioners (control), followed by treatment discontinuation for 12 weeks. Amongst these 4 groups, participants treated with JM-LD had signficant reduction in blood glucose and increased insulin secretion during 75 gram OGTT. This effect was sustained after discontinuation of JM-LD for 3 months. Microbiota and RNA analysis indicated that JM-LD caused favorable changes in microbiota and gene expression which correlated with these metabolic changes.\n\nBased on these consistent evidence, we produced a proprietary JM formula consisting of a fixed combination of extracts of CAL with low dose (JM-LD) or high dose extracts of Oph (JM-HD) under good manufacturing practice. The study was approved by the Hong Kong Department of Health for investigational use aimed at registering JM as a novel CM for prevention and treatment of T2D.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nA 24-week treatment with JM in people with T2D reduce glucose excursion and improve beta-cell function through changes in gut microbiota and gene expression\n\nStudy design:\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT to assess the efficacy, safety and multiomic effects of JM and its optimal dose in people with early T2D (within 6 years) not treated with glucose lowering drugs.\n\nIntervention:\n\nRandomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 24-week treatment with\n\n1. JM-LD in powder form (13.5 g twice daily) to be dissolved in 250 ml of hot water\n2. JM-HD in powder form (13.5 g twice daily) to be dissolved in 250 ml of hot water or\n3. matching placebo in powder form (13.5 g twice daily) to be dissolved in 250 ml of hot water followed by treatment discontinuation for 3 months\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo compare changes in glucose excursion during MMTT after 24 week treatment with JM-LD or JM-HD compared to placebo\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the sustained effect of JM on glucose exursion during MMTT 12 weeks after JM discontinuation compared to placebo\n2. To compare changes in cardiometabolic risk factors including blood pressure, lipids and body weight and HbA1c as well as insulin secretion and resistance during MMTT after 24 weeks of JM treatment compared to placebo\n3. To compare changes in biomarkers and multiomics and their correlations with metabolic changes after 24 weeks of JM treatment compared to placebo\n\nPrimary outcome measure:\n\nBetween-group difference in area-under-the-curve of plasma glucose (AUC-PG) during MMTT in the JM group versus changes in the placebo group (difference-difference) from week 0 to 24 (on treatment)\n\nSample size:\n\nIn the aforementioned 12-week study of JM versus placebo in people with prediabetes, the mean (SD) of AUC-PG during OGTT in placebo group was 18.9 (1.8) mmol/L/min. The AUC-PG was 1.89 mmol/L/min, i.e. 10% lower in the JM-LD group than the placebo group. Based on a conservative estimation of a superiority margin of 0.945 (5% of mean difference) in favor of JM-HD versus placebo, 45 participants in each arm are needed to achieve an 80% power at one-sided significance level of 5%. Allowing a 20% drop out rate, we shall assign 54 participants to each of 3 groups with a total of 162 participants.\n\nStudy site:\n\nThe study will be conducted at Ward 3M, Diabetes and Endocrine Research Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) stipulated by the CUHK-NTEC Clinical Research Management Office\n\nSignificance of the study:\n\nThis double-blind placebo-controlled RCT will provide data in support of the beneficial effects of a novel proprietary CM formula (JM) on glycemic excursion in people with early T2D as a therapeutic option. The effects of JM on beta-cell function, insulin resistance, biomarkers, multiomics and gut microbiota will explain the mechanisms underlying the benefits of JM. These data will provide the basis for conduct of large-scale study to examine the effects of JM in the prevention of T2D and its progression to non-communicable diseases.",

      "detailed_description": "Despite a large body of evidence demonstrating promising effects of resveratrol in rodents, human studies are still lacking and both preventive and therapeutic value of resveratrol in humans remains to be elucidated. The published evidence is not sufficiently strong to recommend for the administration of resveratrol to humans, beyond dietary sources. On the other hand, animal data are promising in prevention of various cancer types, coronary heart diseases and diabetes which strongly indicate the need for human clinical trials.\n\nFurthermore, data are lacking either about safety during long-term administration, or on the efficacy of resveratrol administration in patients with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of resveratrol on inflammatory mediators in type 2 diabetic patients in vivo.\n\nThis research will investigate the hypothesis that resveratrol, when given orally to type 2 diabetic subjects for 24 weeks induces a decrease in values of high-sensitivity CRP (C-reactive protein) (primary outcome measure), IL-6 (Interleukin-6), PTX3 (pentraxin 3).\n\nThe investigators will also investigate the hypothesis that resveratrol has an antioxidant activity, improves insulin sensitivity and lipid pattern, down-regulates bone-turnover. Secondary outcomes are therefore variations in the following variables: TAS (total antioxidant status), glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, body composition (evaluated by Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry DXA-), bone mineral density (DXA).\n\nFinally, the investigators are interested in evaluating efficacy, safety and tolerability of two different dosages of resveratrol: 500 mg/day and 40 mg/day.",

      "brief_summary": "Around the world, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been increasing since the last two decades, with approximately 347 million patients with diabetes by 2013 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This pronounced increase is due to an increase in the prevalence of obesity, reduction in physical activity levels, accelerated urbanization and aging of the population. In Colombia, T2DM ranks fifth in the main morbidity and mortality causes, including only deaths caused directly and without adding the strong influence that T2DM has on cardiovascular disease mortality.\n\nInsufficient tissue response to normal insulin concentrations, called insulin resistance, is one of the central pathophysiological mechanisms in the development of T2DM. However, there is currently no simple, practical, safe and reproducible method that allows the diagnosis or identification of insulin resistance, nor the follow-up to its evolution. At the moment, the gold standard for assessing the degree of insulin sensitivity or resistance is the \"hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp\", a laborious technique, of high cost and high technical difficulty, requiring specialized personnel and hospitalization. Non-invasive methods based on mathematical regressions, such as the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), are imperfect and widely variable, and have not been validated in the Latin American population, less Still Colombian.\n\nTherefore, the development of new, easily obtainable quantitative tools for the diagnosis of insulin resistance is required. This requires not only the identification of new and better biomarkers, but also the determination of their diagnostic performance and operational characteristics.\n\nThis project will investigate 3 molecular targets (myokines), novel and easy to measure, with high probability of being good biomarkers of insulin resistance. The research will include validation of its association with insulin resistance measured by the reference method, as well as its measurement in apparently healthy individuals. Finally, operator-receiver characteristics of each test will be analyzed, in order to propose a cutoff point for the diagnosis of insulin resistance.",
      "detailed_description": "The objectives of the project are: 1) To identify, within a group of 3 potential new biomarkers of insulin resistance, those that are significantly associated with the presence of this phenomenon in our population, 2) Establish, analyze and apply reference values for each one of these three biomarkers in Colombian population. 3) To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, statistical C (operational performance), predictive values and likelihood ratios of each of the biomarkers studied for the diagnosis of insulin resistance versus a standard gold technique and 4) Different biomarkers evaluated, in order to select the best one (s) for clinical use, as well as to propose a cutoff point for detection of insulin resistance for each of them.\n\nMethodology: A cross-sectional, diagnostic test evaluation study will be conducted, including apparently healthy Adults of both sexes, with ages between 35 and 65 years, coming from Bogot\u00e1, without any significant comorbidity.\n\nAs initial evaluation will be carried out measurement of height, weight, percentage of body fat, blood pressure, diet questionnaire, physical activity and sociocultural characteristics. For patients with prediabetes and T2DM, the time elapsed since the diagnosis will be obtained, as well as information about pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment that they are receiving.\n\nFor the serological evaluation, a sample of venous blood should be taken in the fasted state, with the aim of measuring the following markers: Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) , Myonectin, and Myostatin. In addition to routine tests such as fasting glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting insulinemia, lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C) and C-reactive protein. Additionally, all subjects will participate in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\n\nIn addition to the gold standard of measurement of insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), six of the tools currently available for the search of insulin resistance, all derived from calculations from the measurements of The HOMA beta-cell function (HOMA beta-cell%), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), index 1 / fasting insulin, corrected insulin response, insulin / glucose ratio and insulinemia Of fasting.\n\nFor each biomarker, an operator / receiver characteristics curve (ROC curve) will be calculated, calculating diagnostic performance and cutoff points with the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. A first approximation will be made to baseline values for these tests, based on the distribution of the tests in healthy, and one or more insulin resistance biomarkers with their recommended cutoff points will be proposed.",

The prevalence of diabetic patients in dialysis reaches even the 30% of the dialysis population (USRDS) with an incidence rate, in some countries, up to 40%. The 5 years surviving time of diabetic patients in dialysis is about the 20% and, compared to the hypertension and glomerulonephritis complications, still remains the worst. Diabetes is often associated to several comorbid factors such as hypertension, autonomic neuropathy, vasculopathy, metabolic disorders (ketoacidosis, poor glycaemic control), and electrolyte disorders. So, the diabetic patient is fragile, with a rather poor tolerance to dialysis, lack of achievement of dry body weight and inadequate dialysis. In order to gain a more detailed insight into a possible better tolerance to dialysis, arising from the elimination of acetate in dialysate bath (Acetate Free Biofiltration) and from the use of an automatic system to control the blood volume (Blood Volume Control),the investigators would like to investigate the cardiovascular stability and the frequency of intradialytic symptoms in a prospective, randomized, cross-over study.",

The study is divided in three phases: the first one, three months long, is the baseline in standard bicarbonate dialysis, then all the patients are shifted to AFB with BVC, for other three months, while the last three months long phase, after a randomization, has the aim to identify the relative contribution of each factor (absence of acetate in the bath or BVC) in the treatment tolerance improvement(if any).

      "detailed_description": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. In a large percentage of cases, the risk factors for CVD are modifiable if the responsible patient's phenotype is identified and appropriately treated. In particular, the metabolic syndrome encompasses insulin resistance, central obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, which are all major risk factors for CVD. These risk factors also cause underlying vascular abnormalities, i.e. endothelial dysfunction, that leads to progression of CVD. Endothelial function is the balance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances produced by the endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of insulin resistance and hypertension. In addition, endothelial dysfunction represents a very early step in the process of atherosclerosis and is associated with increased adverse CVD outcomes.\n\nIt has been well established that lifestyle modifications (changes in dietary intake and increase in physical activity) can effectively improve CVD risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. The success of maintaining these lifestyle changes in humans over the long term is poor. Therefore, strategies to reduce prevalence of metabolic syndrome by pharmacological means have been adopted by practicing physicians. However, because of the widespread use of dietary supplements by the general public, nutritional supplementation that includes use of natural products that effectively modify the components of metabolic syndrome represent an attractive approach.\n\nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables clearly has been shown to have significant health benefits. In particular, increased consumption of blueberries has demonstrated beneficial health effects for CVD and certain components of the metabolic syndrome, such as hypertension, insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes. These health benefits from blueberries may be attributable to their phenolic bioactive compounds, such as anthocyanins, which also have antioxidant properties. Although both human and animal studies demonstrated the anti-diabetic effect of blueberries, there is a paucity of data detailing the efficacy of increased blueberry consumption upon CVD risk factor modification in human subjects. Thus, given the concern regarding the ability to significantly increase and maintain an individual's fruit and vegetable consumption long-term, the role of dietary supplementation with bioactive components contained in whole blueberries becomes not only an attractive, but a feasible daily dietary intervention.\n\nOur lab has previously shown that obese, nondiabetic and insulin-resistant human subjects that consumed blueberry powder once a day (in the form of a blueberry smoothie) for 6 weeks improved their insulin sensitivity when compared to their counterparts that consumed a placebo smoothie. Unfortunately, definitive blood pressure measurements were not conducted in this study. The investigators used a single clinic measurement which did not show any blood pressure lowering effects with consuming the blueberry smoothies. An 8-wk preclinical trialin spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, however, showed that supplementation with blueberry powder lowered systolic blood pressure. Thus, it is plausible that blood pressure lowering effects were not seen in our previous study because the investigators did not evaluate a suitable population (with hypertension) and did not use a more precise technique.\n\nTherefore, based on the positive results in our prior human study with the use of blueberry powder increasing insulin sensitivity and given the relationship of CVD risk factors to insulin resistance, this project's overall objective is to examine the role of dietary supplementation with blueberry powder on CVD risk factors in subjects with metabolic syndrome. In particular, the investigators will evaluate changes in insulin sensitivity with the use of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), hypertension with the use of a precise ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system and vascular reactivity as a surrogate marker for underlying endothelial abnormalities. To our knowledge, no research studies have evaluated endothelial function and blueberries in humans. To accomplish our goal, the investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study with a fixed amount of blueberry powder in the form of a smoothie. The investigators hypothesize that increased daily consumption of blueberry powder will be effective in increasing insulin sensitivity, decreasing blood pressure, and improving vascular wall function in a population with metabolic syndrome that is at high-risk for CVD.",

Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of MK-0646 when given together with etoposide and cisplatin and to see how well it works in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES:\n\n* To determine the recommended phase II dose of MK-0646 in combination with a standard etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy regimen in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. (phase I)\n* To assess the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (phases I and II)\n* To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients. (phase I)\n* To assess the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of objective response rate, as well as complete response rate in these patients. (phase II)\n* To assess progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (phase II)\n* To explore the predictive and prognostic impact of biomarkers in patients treated with this regimen. (phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of MK-0646 followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive MK-0646 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV and etoposide IV once daily on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) may continue MK-0646 in the absence of disease progression, with temporary discontinuation while undergoing prophylactic cranial irradiation or thoracic radiotherapy.\n\nBlood samples are collected at baseline (pre-dose) and periodically for biomarker and pharmacogenetic correlative studies. Blood samples are analyzed for changes in expression of IGF biomarkers (e.g., IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGF-PB), haplotype tagging analysis of the IGF-1R, and evaluation of the immunoglobulin G fragment C receptor polymorphisms.\n\nAfter completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with responding disease (i.e., CR, PR, or stable disease) are followed every 3 months until relapse or progression.",

Ninety participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (n=30 each): a ketogenic-caloric restricted diet, a normal-fat caloric restricted diet, or a control group (normal-fat without caloric restriction). Anthropometric parameters and dietary intake will be evaluated at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and week 12 for measuring fasting glucose, insulin, LPS, inflammatory cytokines. Dietary adherence will be monitored through food records.

Data in mice models have recently demonstrated that circulating immunoglobulins G (IgG) could be involved in the process. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), who are characterized by low circulating levels of IgG, might represent an ideal model to clarify the role played in vivo in humans by circulating IgG. Polyclonal IgG, obtained from multiple donors, given intravenously (IVIgG), are used to treat various immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases, including CVID. By using this disease and its treatment by IVIgG as a model, aim of the current study is to clarify whether IgG affect endothelial function and insulin sensitivity in humans in vivo and whether the action of IgG on the endothelium involves a direct interaction with the endothelial cells.",
      "detailed_description": "For this purposes, 24 patients with CVID, receiving the last therapeutic dose of IVIgG infusion 5-weeks before the baseline measurements (CVID-IVIgG group), are studied. In all subjects, endothelial function is evaluated as flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, measured by ultrasonographic technique at baseline and 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after IVIgG infusion. FMD is also measured in a group of IVIgG naive CVID patients (number of patients recruited depending on availability) and a group of control healthy subjects. The latter FMD measurements serve only as a mere reference of pathological or normal values in condition of deficiency or normal levels of circulating IgG and are not used for primary outcome evaluation. To dissect further the mechanisms of improved endothelial function after IVIgG infusion, we investigate the role of human IgG on the production of Nitric Oxide (NO) in vitro on Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells (HCAEC) isolated from normal human coronary arteries.",

      "detailed_description": "Previous investigations have demonstrated that simply adding 3 small protein feedings to the normal diet of overweight men and women, independent of caloric restriction and/or engaging in exercise training, significantly reduces body weight, fat mass, abdominal fat, waist circumference, and blood fat (triglyceride) levels (Arciero et al JAP, 2014), and confirms previous research (Baer et al, J Nutr, 2011). This timed ingestion is referred to as protein pacing (PP) and has been utilized in numerous scientific investigations with a great deal of success by the PI (see references). This one, simple, dietary modification, independent of reducing calorie intake and/or engaging in exercise training, is noteworthy and exceptional in terms of health improvements derived from diet alone. Unfortunately, the incidence and healthcare costs associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are overwhelming. Currently, more than 34 million Americans have T2DM (1 in 10) and is increasing at alarming rates (\\>4.0%/year) among all segments of the population. Equally disturbing, T2DM costs the US more than $330 billion a year, including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced worker productivity. Thus, identifying evidence-based, effective, time-efficient, and easy-to-follow lifestyle strategies are vital to reducing these staggering healthcare costs and improving the health of T2DM patients. Indeed, lifestyle therapies remain the most effective treatments for T2DM outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the effects of protein (whey) supplementation added to the normal diet of pre-diabetes or diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) men and women on plasma glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and total body fat levels.

This unilateral tissue-level damage contributes to worsening disability and insulin resistance. This VA Merit Award will advance the investigators' understanding of the potential for strength training (ST) to reverse stroke-related muscle abnormalities to improve metabolic health, strength, and function. It will be the first study to thoroughly investigate the effects of ST on muscle atrophy, intramuscular fat, muscle fiber characteristics, capillary density and insulin sensitivity after stroke.",
      "detailed_description": "This study investigates the hypothesis that a novel, high intensity, high repetition ST program will improve abnormalities in paretic and non-paretic leg muscle volume and composition compared to an attention-matched control regimen of supervised stretching over a 3-month intervention period in those disabled by stroke. The investigators further hypothesize that ST-induced skeletal muscle adaptation will translate into improved insulin sensitivity, strength, and function in this population. The specific objectives are to: 1) Determine the effects ST compared to a control intervention on paretic and non-paretic abnormalities in skeletal muscle volume, intramuscular fat, muscle fiber distribution, muscle capillary density, and muscle inflammation in chronically disabled stroke survivors. 2) Determine the effects ST compared to a control intervention on insulin sensitivity in stroke survivors, and whether structural and cellular skeletal muscle mechanisms contribute to improvements in insulin sensitivity after ST. 3) Determine the effects ST compared to a control intervention on physical function (strength, walking speed and balance) in stroke survivors, and whether structural skeletal muscle mechanisms predict ST-induced functional improvement.\n\nThe project design consists of 4 phases over 5 months for stroke participants enrolled in either of the two intervention arms (ST vs. CONTROL). During phase 1 the investigators will screen and consent chronic stroke patients with residual gait deficits. Phase 2 (3 weeks) will consist of baseline testing that includes dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning, bilateral CT scanning of the legs, bilateral vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, strength testing, timed walks, balance measurements, oral glucose tolerance testing, and hyperglycemic clamp testing. Following completion of baseline testing, volunteers are to be randomized to ST or the CONTROL group. Phase 3 (Intervention Phase, 3 months) will begin with 2 sessions of acclimatization for those assigned to the ST group. ST will then be progressed to 2 sets of 20 repetitions on each leg on each machine (Keiser Leg Press, Leg Extension, Leg Curl) with gradual increases in resistance over 3 months. Those in the CONTROL group will receive equal exposure to health care personnel in the Baltimore VA Exercise facility, performing a full battery of upper and lower body passive and active stretching exercises at each intervention session. In Phase 4 all baseline testing and laboratory analyses will be repeated.\n\nDeveloping evidence-based therapies to combat skeletal muscle deterioration is highly relevant for chronically disabled stoke survivors. There is mounting evidence that current models of post-stroke rehabilitation are not optimal for maximizing recovery of muscle mass, strength, and metabolic health. The proposed research will develop new insight into the utility of progressive ST for reversing detrimental changes to gross muscle composition, muscle molecular phenotype, muscle inflammation, and muscle capillarization. Changes to any or all of these muscle parameters should have measurable impact on both whole body insulin sensitivity and function. Collectively, the results from this trial may change the current standard of care for stroke survivors by providing evidenced reasons for augmenting physical therapists' treatments, allowing more intense and diverse therapy sessions for maintenance of skeletal muscle.",

Mexico has the highest prevalence of obesity, (Secretar\u00eda de Salud, 2009); 34.4% of children and 35% of adolescents are overweight or obese (ENSANUT 2012). Obesity has major health consequences for children and adolescents; On the other hand, undernutrition as well has important deleterious consequences on children's health.\n\nAnything that disrupts energy balance may cause individuals to be underweight, overweight or obese. Fat has been considered an endocrine organ for some time (Elizondo, 2011). Recently, skeletal muscle has been shown to function as a peripheral endocrine organ by releasing myokines, (Pedersen, 2012). Most recently, a new identified hormone secreted by muscle tissue in mouse, irisin, has been discovered. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development. Irisin was induced with exercise in mice and humans which caused an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake (Bostr\u00f6m et al., 2012).\n\nIrisin was thus, promptly hypothesized as a hormone influencing body weight, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, among other conditions (Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2012). Some studies have indicated that circulating levels of irisin in humans correlate positively with anthropometric parameters such as BMI, fat mass, fat free mass, and are higher in obese patients compared to lean ones (Stengel et al., 2013; Huh et al., 2012; Roca-Rivada et al., 2013; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo, 2014). Studies have shown an association between irisin levels, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (Park et al., 2013; de la Iglesia et al., 2014; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo et al., 2014). However, some others have found a negative correlation with anthropometric parameters, finding lower irisin levels in obese patients (Moreno-Navarrete et al., 2013). Noteworthy, all these studies have been performed in adults. To date, there are only two studies evaluating irisin levels in children. One found that a 1-year long lifestyle intervention program was associated with an elevation in irisin levels in obese children, although no correlation was found between irisin levels and anthropometric markers (Bl\u00fcher et al., 2014). The other study investigated normal weight Saudi children and found correlations between circulating irisin and glucose and HDLc, but a negative association with insulin resistance (Al-Daghri et al, 2014).\n\nBesides, associations between irisin levels and adiponectin, leptin and resistin in the set of obesity have been explored, the three of them are implicated in the physiopatology of obesity.\n\nAs there are still conflicting data regarding the association of irisin with anthropometric parameters, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as its 'association with other adiponectines, and most important, there is scarce data of these associations in children, the objective of this study will be to correlate the circulating irisin and adipokines levels across a broad spectrum of body mass index ranging from undernourished to obese as well as with insulin resistance and risk factors for the metabolic syndrome in Hispanic children.\n\nThe sample size with statistical power for this study yielded a sample of 40 children. Frozen stored plasma (-80\u00b0C) will be taken from a previous study performed in children which has been published (Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2014). The samples will be divided into five groups, 8 per group, according to the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics body mass index percentile classification: 1.) underweight = \\<3 percentile; 2.) normal weight = \\>3 - \\< 85 percentile; 3.) Overweight = \\>85 - \\< 95 percentile, and 4.) obese = \\> 95 percentile. The fifth group will correspond to children with known metabolic syndrome according to the classification specified by Cooks et al (2008). Anthropometric measurements will include BMI, percentile BMI, waist circumference, % body fat, fat mass, fat free mass, and triceps skin fold. Biochemical measurements will include glucose, total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL-c) and triglycerides. Clinical measurements will include blood pressure, physical activity records and dietary habits. All biochemical, anthropometric and clinical measurements were previously performed in a former published study (Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2014).\n\nIrisin, adiponectin and leptin will be measured in plasma media using commercial ELISA kits.",
      "detailed_description": "Background Childhood obesity is one of the most serious global public health challenges of the 21st century (Daniels et al., 2009). Mexico has the highest prevalence of obesity, worldwide; 34.4% of children and 35% of adolescents are overweight or obese (ENSANUT 2012). Among other complications, overweight and obese children are predisposed to develop dyslipidemias, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at a younger age, as well as to become obese as adults (Daniels et al., 2009; Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2010). On the other hand, undernutrition in children conveys to very detrimental health effects such as stunting, puberty retardation, motor retardation (Roulet et al., 2005), osteoporosis and fractures (Saunders et al., 2011), immunologic deficit, and altered function of every organ and system, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system, among others (Lecours et al, 2001; Saunders et al., 2011).\n\nA balance between energy intake and energy expenditure is required to sustain a normal body weight. Anything that disrupts this balance may cause individuals to be underweight, overweight or obese. Diverse signals, central and peripheric participate in the regulation of energy balance. Fat has been considered an endocrine organ due to the many peptides and hormones that it secrets that act upon peripheral and central tissues, and their contribution to insulin resistance or sensitivity and body weight regulation among other functions (Elizondo, 2011). Recently, skeletal muscle has been shown to function as a peripheral endocrine organ by releasing myokines, peptide signals, which are implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways (Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012). Most recently, a new identified hormone secreted by muscle tissue in mouse, irisin, has been discovered. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development. In mouse, PGC1alfa expression in muscle stimulates increase in expression of FNDC5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as this novel hormone, irisin. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and medley increased irisin levels in blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake (Bostr\u00f6m et al., 2012).\n\nIrisin was thus, promptly hypothesized as a hormone influencing body weight, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, among other conditions (Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2012). Some studies have indicated that circulating levels of irisin in humans correlate positively with anthropometric parameters such as BMI, fat mass, fat free mass, and are higher as these parameters increase, this is, irisin levels are higher in obese patients compared to lean ones (Stengel et al., 2013; Huh et al., 2012; Roca-Rivada et al., 2013; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo et al., 2014). Studies have shown an association between irisin levels, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (Park et al., 2013; de la Iglesia et al., 2014; Crujeiras et al., 2014; Pardo et al., 2014). However, some others have found a negative correlation with anthropometric parameters, finding lower irisin levels in obese patients (Moreno-Navarrete et al., 2013). Noteworthy, all these studies have been performed in adults in different circumstances or diseased states. To date, there are only two studies evaluating irisin levels in children. One found that a 1-year long lifestyle intervention program was associated with improvement in anthropometric and metabolic parameters and led to an elevation in irisin levels in obese children, although no correlation was found between irisin levels and anthropometric markers (Bl\u00fcher et al., 2014). The other study investigated normal weight Saudi children and found correlations between circulating irisin and glucose and HDLc, but a negative association with insulin resistance (Al-Daghri et al., 2014).\n\nBesides, associations between irisin levels and adiponectin, leptin and resistin in the set of obesity have been explored. Leptin plays a pivotal role in regulating energy homeostasis, food intake and many neuroendocrine functions, specially triggering puberty in children. Leptin is increased in obese patients, associated with a leptin-resistant state (Bl\u00fcher and Mantzoros, 2009). Adiponectin is an insulin sensitizing hormone; obese patients have lower levels than normal-weight ones. Circulating adiponectin levels are low in central obesity (Dalamaga et al., 2012), and this low level has been associated with the metabolic syndrome across all ages (Siitonen et al., 2011). Resistin has been associated with insulin resistance, and recently as a proinflamatory adipocytokine (McTernan et al., 2006). Some studies have found a negative correlation between irisin and adiponectin levels (Park et al., 2013), while other have found no association either with leptin or adiponectin (Bl\u00fcher et al., 2014) here are still conflicting data regarding the association of irisin with anthropometric parameters, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as its 'association with other adipokines, and most important, there is scarce data of these associations in children, the objective of this study will be to correlate the circulating irisin and adipokines levels across a broad spectrum of body mass index ranging from undernourished to obese as well as with insulin resistance and risk factors for the metabolic syndrome in Hispanic children.\n\nThere is still conflicting data regarding the association of irisin with anthropometric parameters, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as its 'association with other adipokines, and most important, there is scarce data of these associations in children. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to correlate the circulating irisin and adipokines levels across a broad spectrum of body mass index ranging from undernourished to obese as well as with insulin resistance and risk factors for the metabolic syndrome in Hispanic children.\n\nStudy Population The population was previously described. (Elizondo-Montemayor et al., 2014) An open invitation was made to school-aged children from eight public schools representative of all geographical areas of Monterrey, the second largest city in M\u00e9xico. Children that accepted the invitation were randomly selected and screened according to BMI percentiles. The sample size is 40 children. The population will be divided into five groups, 8 per group. Four of the groups will be divided according to the CDC body mass index percentiles: 1.) underweight = \\<3percentile; 2.) normal weight = \\>3 - \\< 85 percentile; 3.) Overweight = \\>85 - \\< 95 percentile, and 4.) obese = \\> 95 percentile. The fifth group will correspond to children with known metabolic syndrome.\n\nSigned consent was obtained from both parents/care givers and children. Approvals by the Ethics and Research Committees of the School of Medicine Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey and by the State Health Secretariat, as well as by the Education Authorities were obtained. Participants did not receive gratification during the study.\n\nAnthropometric and Clinical Evaluation Anthropometric measurements were performed in all participants at each school. Height was determined to the nearest 0.5 cm (portable Seca\u00ae stadiometer, North America) and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg while children wore light clothing, no socks or shoes (TANITA TBF 300\u00ae scale, Arlington, Illinois). Percentage of body fat (%BF) was measured by bioimpedance (same TANITA scale). WC was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the level of the umbilicus with a flexible fiberglass tape while the subjects were standing, after gently exhaling, and with no clothing on the area. Tricipital skin fold (TSF) was measured using a Lange skinfold caliper. BMI was calculated by weight-kilograms divided by the square of height-meters. Fat mass and fat free mass were calculated according to the specific predetermined formulas. Measurements were performed at the same time each day by the same three trained registered dietitians (RD) in all children to control the inter-observer variability. Blood pressure was measured by the same physician, using an aneroid sphygmomanometer (Welch-Allyn\u00ae) following the American Heart Association (AHA) technique; two measurements were obtained while participants were calmed and seated.\n\nLaboratory Assessment Blood samples were taken after a 12-hour overnight fast and were kept at 2 to 8\u00b0C and centrifuged within the first 3 hours. Serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and glucose were measured by reflective photometry (Beer-Lambert's law) using an automated analyzer (Architect c8000; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), with an intra- and inter-assay coefficient variation below 4.7%. Plasma samples were then stored at -80\u00b0C. Irisin, adiponectin, insulin and leptin will be measured in plasma media using commercial ELISA kits. The assays will be conducted in 96-well microplates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Irisin, adiponectin, insulin and leptin ELISA kit; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). Absorbance from each sample will measured in duplicate using a spectrophotometric microplate reader at wavelength of 450 nm (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).\n\nStatistical Methods MINITAB version 16 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA) will be used to analyze the differences between anthropometric and biochemical parameters and irisin levels; Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) will be used to incorporate the input of data. The results will be expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.), as absolute number or as percentage (%) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Comparisons between groups for the dependent variables will be made using paired Student\u00b4s t-test for means and McNemar test for proportions. For independent variables, the normality will be revised both, graphically and by the Shapiro-Wilk test, and subsequently, the comparisons between groups will be determined using z-test. To assess the association between anthropometric, clinical and biochemical variables and irisin levels, a simple linear regression will be used. The mean comparisons between gender groups will be determined using t-test for independent samples. All tests will be interpreted based on two-tailed hypothesis. The significance level will be set at 0.05 in all cases.",

      "brief_summary": "Premixed insulin-based therapy is a standard insulin treatment strategy in Austria. The widespread use of premixed insulin is explained by high acceptance by health care professionals and patients due to one single product and flexible number of injections (1-3 daily) which covers the demand in controlling fasting and postprandial glucose excursions of most patients with diabetes. However, the use of pre-mixed insulin frequently leads to a high insulin demand and consequently weight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Hence, achieve good metabolic control in these patients remains a major challenge.\n\nFor those patients, the approach to treatment intensification without facing the typical risks of insulin treatment (hypoglycemia and weight increase) is of major importance. One, so far not exploited option may be the BIT-strategy: Basal insulin in combination with incretin-based therapy.\n\nPathophysiologically basal insulin inhibits glucose production in the liver, decreases hepatic insulin resistance and improves the function of beta cells in the postprandial state by discharge of fasting insulin secretion. During further diabetes progression steadily increasing HbA1c levels - despite good fasting blood glucose control - indicate the need for additional intervention of meal-related glucose excursions. In this stage of type-2 diabetes basal insulin can be combined with prandial (short-acting) insulin or prandial GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, regarding important safety parameters: risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain in the long-term treatment GLP-1 receptor agonists are beneficial.\n\nLixisenatide is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist with a pronounced postprandial (PPG) effect which fits with basal insulin mode of action primarily focused on fasting blood glucose reduction.\n\nTherefore 10 patients (both gender) under treatment with premixed insulin (2-3 times daily) and HbA1c\\>7% will be switched to basal insulin glargine (Lantus, once daily) and GLP-1 receptor agonist Lixisenatide (Lyxumia, once daily). The investigators hypothesize that switching from a therapy based on premixed insulin to a simple, once daily administered combination of basal insulin plus a GLP-1 receptor agonist in patients with type-2 diabetes not achieving therapeutic target (HbA1c\\>7%) is clinically feasable in an out patient setting",

The (mean) daily dose of premixed insulin will be calculated based on the records of the run in period. The initial dose of insulin glargine will be adjusted at about 60% of the daily insulin dose of premixed insulin.

      "brief_summary": "The research is devoted to studying the features of the metabolic syndrome in cancer survivors in childhood is supposed to answer the following questions:\n\n* How can metabolic syndrome be diagnosed in the Russian population of survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas?\n* What are the features of the clinical symptoms of metabolic syndrome in this category of patients?\n* Which genetic mutations are found in cancer survivors of patients with metabolic syndrome; Which of these mutations can be considered as protective or vice versa predisposing to the development of metabolic syndromes? Is the metabolic syndrome associated with an increased frequency of toxic complications of therapy during the intensive stages?",
      "detailed_description": "Brief Overview:\n\nThe remarkable progress in developing curative therapy for childhood cancer over the last 4 to 5 decades has increased awareness of the serious cancer treatment-related late effects experienced by long-term survivors such as premature mortality early deaths, second primary cancers, organ dysfunction (heart, lung, endocrine system), fertility impairment, cognitive deficits, and reduced quality of life. Endocrine disorders, which occur in 30% to 70% of childhood cancer survivors, are among the most frequent late effects of anticancer therapy. Survivors treated with radiation and alkylating agent chemotherapy for hematological malignancies and CNS tumors are at a particularly high risk for endocrine dysfunction.\n\nMost anticancer drugs act directly or indirectly by modifying intracellular metabolism. Therefore, high frequency of acute and late cancer treatment-related organ toxicity can result in metabolic disorders. For example, steroid-induced hypercortism blocks glycolysis and results in insulin resistance of tissues. Insulin resistance is associated with earlier manifestation of diabetes mellitus, obesity etc. The clinical sequelae of metabolic syndrome developing in childhood cancer survivors may include insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia, endothelial failure, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, chronic fatigue syndrome, motor and behavioral disorders.\n\nModern genetics make it possible to create a basis for a personalized approach to the prevention of early and late toxic effects caused by anticancer therapy and the rehabilitation of the childhood cancer survivors.\n\nObjectives:\n\nSpecific Aim 1. Evaluate the frequency and clinical features of the metabolic syndrome in childhood cancer survivors.\n\nHypothesis 1A: Components of the metabolic syndrome are realizing in children and adolescents at all stages of therapy of leukemia and lymphomas, can influence the development of complications and late toxic effects.\n\nHypothesis 1B: Initial health conditions (abnormal IBM, family history, comorbid diseases); drug's toxicity could influence to the appearance of early manifestation of metabolic syndrome.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Evaluate the contribution of functional polymorphisms in candidate genes to metabolic syndrome outcomes among childhood cancer patients.\n\nHypothesis 2A: Genetic polymorphisms involved in the regulation of the insulin resistance and cancer medications during treatment contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome in childhood cancer survivors.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Assess the extent to which genetic predictors, doses of drugs, risk factors improve the discriminatory performance of standard clinical prediction models for metabolic syndrome outcomes among childhood cancer survivors.\n\nHypothesis 3 A: Development of metabolic syndrome in cancer patients depends of genetic determinants and toxic effects of antitumor therapy.\n\nSecondary Aim 1: Assess the definition of metabolic syndrome in cohort of patients of leukemia and lymphoma and survivors.\n\nHypothesis 1A: Episodes of triglyceridemic, insulin resistance (Hyperglycemia, HOMA\\>2,7, Steroid Diabetes) during the treatment could be the base evidence marker of Metabolic Syndrome in patients treated by antitumor therapy.\n\nHypothesis 1 B: Endothelial dysfunction as a clinical component of metabolic syndrome is responsible for cardiovascular abnormalities in cancer survivors.\n\nExploratory Aim 1: Assess the association of biomarkers and genetic predictors among childhood cancer survivors with therapeutic exposures (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) and metabolic syndrome.\n\nEvaluation:\n\nEligible persons who consent to participate in this trial will be asked to do the following:\n\n* Vital sign measurement including resting heart rate, blood pressure, height, and weight.\n* A total of 12 mL of blood will be collected in 3 test tubes. Biomarker analysis will be completed by Laboratory of Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center.\n* A Total of 4 mL of blood in 1 test tube will be used for genotyping for the presence of polymorphic variants in genes involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics, insulin resistance and carbohydrate metabolism in the biomolecular laboratory of Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center.\n* An echocardiogram and ultrasound will be performed to assess cardiac function.\n* CAVI and ABI pulse wave velocity will be non-invasively measured by using the SphygmoCor VaSera VS-1500N.

The model of overfeeding represents a very good study model of the metabolic complications of obesity, since it has been shown to induce a transient state of insulin resistance in the human.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to study the effects of a overfeeding (+50% of daily caloric needs over 31 days) with or without polyphenols supplementation (2g/days over 31 days) on insulin sensitivity measured in the setting of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and on post prandial partitioning of exogenous lipids after a test meal.\n\nDuring 31 days, the volunteers will consume chocolate bars, chips, chocolate breads and cola in addition to their usual diet and will be supplemented with 2g of grape polyphenols extract or with placebo.",

This omission is despite heart disease being a major cause of death in diabetes. There remains insufficient information on the usefulness of these foods in diabetes. To improve evidence-based guidance for tree nut recommendations, the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review of the effect of tree nuts on diabetes control and features of the metabolic syndrome. The systematic review process allows the combining of the results from many small studies in order to arrive at a pooled estimate, similar to a weighted average, of the true effect. The investigators will be able to explore whether eating tree nuts has different effects between men and women, in different age groups and background disease states, and whether or not the effect of tree nuts depends on the dose and background diet. The findings of this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of Canadians through informing diabetes association recommendations and heart association recommendations where they relate to diabetes.",
      "detailed_description": "Background: Tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts)are an important source of unsaturated fatty acids, vegetable protein, and fibre, as well as minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients. Although the dietary guidelines for Americans and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend the consumption of nuts for cardiovascular risk reduction and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a qualified coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction claim for nuts, none of the diabetes associations have addressed nuts in their most recent recommendations. This omission is despite CHD being a major cause of death in diabetes. Several trials have been undertaken in diabetes, some of which, including the largest to date by our group, have demonstrated advantages in glycemic control. Although the remaining trials have failed to show a significant improvement in glycemic control, the direction of the effect has favored nuts, along with improvements in complementary markers of metabolic control.\n\nNeed for a review: The lack of high quality data in this area to support diabetes recommendations represents an urgent call for stronger evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials remains the \"Gold Standard\" of evidence for nutrition guidelines development.\n\nObjective: To provide evidence-based guidance for diabetes guidelines, we will conduct two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled feeding trials to assess the effect of tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts) on cardiometabolic control: (1) \"Tree nuts and glycemic control\" and (2) \"Tree nuts and features of the metabolic syndrome\".\n\nDesign: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\nData sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms.\n\nStudy selection: Intervention trials that investigate the effect of exchanging nuts for other diets on cardiometabolic risk outcomes in humans will be included. Studies that are \\<3-weeks diet duration, lack a control, or report non-isocaloric comparisons will be excluded.\n\nData extraction: Independent investigators (\u22652) will extract information about study design, sample size, subject characteristics, nut form, dose, follow-up, and the composition of the background diets. Mean\u00b1SEM values will be extracted for all endpoints. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data. Risk of bias and study quality will be assessed using the risk of bias tool and the Heyland Methodological Quality Score (MQS), respectively.\n\nOutcomes: The two proposed analyses will assess a set of outcomes related to a different area of cardiometabolic control: (1) glycemic control (glycated blood proteins\\[HbA1c, fructosamine, glycated albumin\\], fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance \\[HOMA-IR\\]) and (2) harmonized metabolic syndrome features (waist circumference, TG, HDL-C, blood pressure, fasting glucose).\n\nData synthesis: Pooled analyses will be conducted using the Generic Inverse Variance method with random effects models. Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Exceptions will be made for the use of fixed-effects models where there is \\<5 included trials irrespective of heterogeneity or small trials are being pooled with larger more precise trials in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochrane's Q and quantified by I2. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. A priori subgroup analyses will include nut type, nut dose, duration of follow-up, change in saturated fat intake, change in dietary fibre intake, design (crossover, parallel), study quality, and baseline endpoint values. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, level of feeding control \\[metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice\\], washout in crossover trials, energy balance of the background diet, composition of the background diet \\[total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein\\], change in cholesterol intake, change in glycemic index, etc.). Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of subgroups analyses. Publication bias will be investigated by the inspection of funnel plots and application of Egger's and Begg's tests.\n\nKnowledge translation plan: Results from the two systematic reviews and meta-analyses will be disseminated through traditional means such as interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each stage. Two of the applicants (JLS, CWCK) will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines committees the 2013 CDA Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for nutrition therapy by one of the applicants (JLS) and 2015 European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) CPG for nutrition therapy (JLS, CWCK). Target adopters will include the clinical practice, public health, industry, research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide analyses and improve key messages at each stage.\n\nSignificance: The two proposed systematic reviews and meta-analyses will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of tree nuts in diabetes and metabolic syndrome, strengthening the evidence-base for dietary recommendations and health claims.",

Insulin sensitivity is inversely related to body mass index and body fat. Insulin resistance can be defined as impairment of the normal biological response to both endogenous and exogenous insulin. One of the primary defects underlying the development of type 2 diabetes is thought to be insulin resistance. So, it is present in 85% of these patients with Type 2 DM. It is also related to the pathogenesis of many illnesses which includes coronary heart disease, and hypertension\\[3\\] Early detection of insulin resistance (IR) is important to prevent the development of cardiometabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease. The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index, which has high sensitivity and specificity, has been shown to be more useful in estimating the risk of insulin resistance, instead of more invasive, complex, and expensive direct tests such as pancreatic suppression test and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp technique \\[4\\] HOMA-IR is an approved method for evaluating insulin resistance using fasting glucose and insulin levels and is widely used in clinical practice \\[5\\].\n\nTriglyceride glucose (TyG) index is a novel marker, which has been demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity in identifying insulin resistance \\[6\\].\n\nRecently, the use of the triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, a product of fasting glucose and triglyceride are more easily accessible assessment tools both at the outpatient clinics and at the community level, and are low cost \\[7\\].",

Although it has been shown that lipid lowering agents can improve insulin sensitivity, the effect of lowering free fatty acids on cardiac and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function remains unknown. In this study the investigators want to investigate whether lowering cardiac and muscular lipid content will improve mitochondrial and cellular function in type 2 diabetic patients.\n\nTo this end, type 2 diabetic patients and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls will be included in a blinded cross-over design, in which subjects will receive a lipid lowering agent (Acipimox) or placebo for 2 weeks in random order. During treatment, diabetes medication will be stopped. Baseline measurements will be performed prior to the study and after each treatment to assess cardiac and muscular lipid accumulation, cardiac function, mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity.",

    "explanation": "Based on the provided data, the decision to repurpose insulin is conditional. The potential off-label benefit in new therapeutic areas, need for improved safety profile, and limited studies in pediatric population suggest that there is still room for innovation and improvement in the existing market. Additionally, the market growth rate of 11.1% CAGR indicates a strong and growing market. However, the controlled volatility in export market and import dependency varying with API availability suggest that there may be challenges to overcome. Furthermore, the opportunity for improved formulation to provide an advantage in Tier-2 markets and the suitability for domestic manufacturing incentives make it a promising candidate for repurposing. Therefore, a conditional decision is made to repurpose insulin, pending further research and analysis to address the identified challenges and opportunities."

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to assess a new test to detect antibodies which may form following kidney transplant. These antibodies can be difficult to detect as they do not cause any symptoms but can lead to kidney damage. A new blood test will be performed alongside existing antibody tests to see how well the test functions in comparison and to see how well it is able to distinguish between inflammation caused by antibodies and other sorts of inflammation such as a urinary tract infection. The investigators also want to determine whether it is predictable whom will develop antibodies after a transplant and use these results to change the current way patients are monitored for antibodies after receiving a transplant. In addition to this, the investigators want to establish if patients over 60 years of age are relatively protected against immunological events such as rejection compared to patients who are under 60 years of age. The results could potentially lead to using a different immunosuppression regime based on which population age group patients belong to and lowering the risks associated with these drugs.",
    "detailed_description": "Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA)\n\nPost-transplant monitoring for acute rejection in most centres, focuses on identification of a deterioration in graft function which may be totally asymptomatic. The current best practice to investigate a suspected rejection are renal graft biopsy with appropriate staining for complement component C4d and a serum single antigen bead (SAB) testing. This reactive approach to assessing and monitoring rejection, mainly driven by serial assessments of renal function to determine response to treatment, avoids the need for multiple invasive diagnostic tests such as biopsies, but it poses the risk of missing the early detection and treatment of rejection prior to an objective decline in function. A \"creeping creatinine\", where there are small but sustained increases in creatinine at sequential visits is relatively common and by the time a deterioration consistent with rejection is observed there can already have been significant tissue damage.\n\nDonor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) has been described as a useful biomarker for graft injury secondary to rejection which can be evident in blood weeks to months prior to histological evidence of graft injury. dd-cfDNA levels are high in the immediate post-operative phase, although there is a sharp drop off to low baseline levels after a few days to two weeks making it a useful biomarker in all but the earliest rejection episode. Levels are much higher in antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) when compared to cellular rejection offering improvements in sensitivity when considering ABMR alone (85%) versus rejection of all aetiology (59%). The investigators believe it is important to correlate the findings of the dd-cfDNA sample with the other tests described, so that observations about the percentage dd-cfDNA found in different pathologies and the overall frequency of positive results can be made.\n\nImmunological Factors in Older Age Renal Transplant and Longitudinal Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA) study\n\nOlder patients who undergo kidney transplant (KT) have better survival than those who remain on the waiting list. Nevertheless, outcomes are inferior to younger recipients and KT is often felt to be a predominantly quality of life intervention for older patients. Frailty may have a beneficial influence on the risk of post-transplant adverse immunological events and rejection episodes. If transplanted with good quality organs (all barring elderly deceased after circulatory death - DCD grafts), older kidney transplant recipients will have fewer rejection episodes than younger counterparts. The investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of the outcomes for older age transplant recipients (\\>60) locally, to compare results before and after the change in allocation system which coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the investigators observed less favourable HLA-mismatching, a higher rate of re-intervention (operative or interventional radiology), higher rates of tertiary centre readmissions and higher 1-year mortality rates.\n\nThe previous post-transplant HLA-specific antibody work examined only the first positive sample post-transplant independent of pre-transplant sensitisation status. The investigators, thus, propose prospectively recruiting patients, irrespective of age, undergoing transplant to determine the overall frequency of immunological events and de novo HLA specific antibody formation. Given the importance of early detection and intervention of antibody mediated processes and optimising treatment protocols for frail patients, the investigators aim to expand the research interest in post-transplant antibody monitoring. The investigators, thus, propose prospectively recruiting patients, irrespective of age, undergoing transplant to determine the overall frequency of immunological events and de novo HLA specific antibody formation. Data on clinical outcomes will be collected and the investigators would look to compare the \\<60s with those 60 or older patients undergoing kidney transplant.\n\nDetermining Predictive Models for Post-transplant HLA-specific Antibody Formation\n\nAs an adjunct to the proposed study looking at the influence of age on immunological events, the investigators aim to examine the cohort as a whole to determine the differential clinical outcomes for patients with and without de novo HLA-specific antibody over time. An important part of this arm of the study will be to determine predictive models using machine learning methodology to determine those most at risk for the development of de-novo HLA specific antibody post-transplant.",

    "brief_summary": "Introduction Throughout human history, surgical interventions have been frequently used in human treatment. However, despite their therapeutic properties, the pain experienced by patients, especially in the acute postoperative period, can be quite challenging for clinicians. Acute postoperative pain is an important public health issue. While 80% of patients report experiencing pain in the postoperative period, 88% of them experience moderate or higher levels of pain. According to another study, more than 60% of surgical patients suffer from moderate to severe acute postoperative pain, and this pain has been associated with the development of chronic postoperative pain. Poorly managed postoperative pain can lead to negative outcomes such as lower patient satisfaction, delayed patient recovery, increased length of hospital stay, increased care costs, chronic pain, unnecessary opioid prescription, opioid abuse, overdose, and death. In addition, in order to provide effective pain management, the method of providing preventive analgesic treatment before the pain begins is frequently used. However, this situation may lead to unnecessary medication administration in many patients and consequently, many adverse events such as bleeding, respiratory depression, cardiac events or gastrointestinal system side effects of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics. As a result, the difficulty in predicting acute postoperative pain leads to suboptimal pain management. Therefore, being able to predict which patients will suffer from moderate to severe acute postoperative pain will optimize the risk-benefit ratio of perioperative analgesic treatments and ensure that appropriate treatment is given. Although different studies on this subject have tried to predict postoperative pain with logistic regression analysis, the desired result has not yet been achieved. This situation becomes even more important in surgeries with a high risk of severe pain in the postoperative period, such as lung resection. In order to reduce or prevent postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing lung resection, it is very important for patients to be able to cough without feeling pain and thus to remove secretions from the respiratory tract. If sufficient analgesia is not provided, these patients cannot perform this effectively. This increases complications, hospital stay, and patient care costs. In order to prevent these negative situations and provide optimal analgesia, new methods are needed to predict postoperative pain levels. Numerous models have been proposed in studies to understand the risk factors that will exacerbate severe acute postoperative pain. Most of the research in this area has focused on determining risk factors for postoperative pain using statistical methodology. Previous studies suggest that machine learning models can outperform linear statistical models in classifying postoperative pain-related outcomes when similar features are considered. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are algorithms that can combine and analyze complex data with hundreds of variables and provide new outputs, and can guide an effective solution in predicting and managing the postoperative process. Previous studies have shown promising results in predicting acute postoperative pain with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 using artificial intelligence algorithms to predict pain with perioperative data. However, studies on this topic are needed in a specific surgery such as lung resection, which has the potential for severe pain.\n\nThis study aimed to predict postoperative pain by analyzing perioperative data using AI algorithms in lung resections and to determine the effectiveness of AI algorithms in this regard. Thus, it aimed to reduce unnecessary analgesic use in patients, eliminate possible side effects of these drugs, and start effective analgesic treatment in a timely manner in patients with high pain risk.\n\nPurpose/Hypothesis:\n\nThis study aimed to predict postoperative pain by analyzing perioperative data using AI algorithms in lung resections and to determine the effectiveness of AI algorithms in this regard.\n\nH0: Artificial intelligence algorithms are not effective in predicting postoperative pain in lung resections.\n\nH1: Artificial intelligence algorithms are effective in predicting postoperative pain in lung resections.\n\nMaterial-Method:\n\nThis study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and will be carried out at the SB\u00dc Ankara Atat\u00fcrk Sanatorium Training and Research Hospital after receiving ethics committee approval. Our study is a retro-prospective study. Retrospectively collected patient data will be evaluated prospectively with artificial intelligence algorithms.",

The goal of the body temperature alerting system is to use it during rest, exercise in the heat and during body cooling. Using this system during cooling will allow healthcare professionals and military personnel monitor core temperature to ensure cooling is effective (and prevent hypothermia). Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to validate a body temperature alerting system using physiological responses that occur during rest, exercise in the heat and during body cooling. Multiple cooling modalities will be validated. This study is expanding on a previous intervention IRB#H20-0010 (BHSAI Cooling Study), but will examine body cooling during more intense exercise and while cycling. We will also examine the effectiveness of each cooling modality (passive cooling, mist-fan cooling, hand/forearm immersion, ice towel) on physiological variables after exercise in the heat.",
    "detailed_description": "Design\n\nThe study will be completed in the following timeline:\n\nVisit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing\n\nVist 2: Metabolic Heat Production Visit\n\nVisit 3-6: Trial 1, 2 ,3, 4\n\nVisit specific information is described below, however, specific data collection protocols for dependent variables and procedures are included below the description of the study design. Participants will be asked to sign a photo/video release form (Appendix H) to be used in research projects, scientific publications/conferences and for educational purposes. Participants may be videoed or photographed while exercising or resting in the environmental chamber. Participants will be assigned after medical clearance is granted.\n\nVisit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing\n\nParticipants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for a baseline and VO2max testing day. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) will be measured upon arrival during the baseline visit. The participant will lay supine with a ventilated hood covering their head and torso. The ventilated hood will be attached to a hose connected to a metabolic cart. The metabolic cart will continuously measure respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen consumption, and substrate utilization. The participant will remain under the hood for approximately 30 minutes. Upon completion of BMR, participants will provide a urine sample in a clean urine cup. Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will also be recorded. Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by taking measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door, and the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted to continue to the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) \u22641.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. If USG is greater than 1.025 the subject will be rescheduled for a different day. Height will be measured with a tape measure on Visit 1. Percent body fat will be measured using Air displacement plethysmography (BodPod\u00ae; Cosmed, Software Version 4.2+, Concord, CA, USA). This will take less than \\~5 minutes to complete. This information will be used to describe the subject demographics. Participants will also be asked to complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test on a treadmill and on a cycle ergometer in a thermoneutral environment with about 30 minutes to one hour between. This test will provide aerobic fitness levels of the participants which will be compared between the two exercise protocols. Participants will also be asked about their average weekly physical activity (Appendix K). This visit will take approximately 1-2 hours.\n\nVisit 2: Metabolic Heat Production Visit\n\nIn order to prescribe appropriate exercise intensity, heat production must be controlled. Heat production will be prescribed utilizing a graded exercise test (3-5 minute stages) in the heat (same environmental temperature as trials) that will measure metabolic data via collection of expired air utilizing 2-way non-rebreathing mask in order to calculate heat production and appropriately choose cycling intensities to compare between groups of research participants. This test will occur following the baseline visit. The study procedures will mimic those of trials (described below), with the exception of the exercise protocol. The exercise protocol will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. It will include 5 stages of exercise (graded stages). The participant will wear the ACU during this visit.\n\nVisit 3-6: Trials 1-4\n\nParticipant numbers will be randomly assigned, and 4 trials (mist-fan, forearm, passive cooling, ice towel) will be ordered with a random number generator and assigned to a participant number.\n\nThese orders will be counterbalanced between participants to ensure that there is not an order effect. Each participant will complete four trials as part of the study. Participants will be allowed to make-up trial visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do not meet hydration requirements. Participants will be asked if they have a current illness or taking medications to determine whether they can complete the exercise trial. The participant's visit will be rescheduled if they have a fever, current illness or taking medications that influence body temperature. Participants will complete four trials on four separate days.\n\nTrial #\n\nCooling Intervention\n\n1\n\nPassive Cooling\n\n2\n\nMist-fan Cooling\n\n3\n\nForearm Immersion\n\n4\n\nIce Towel\n\nThe exercise protocol and recovery portions of this study will be conducted in a climatic chamber with ambient temperature approximately 30-40\u00b0C and relative humidity at approximately 30-70%. Participants will drink ad libitum throughout the exercise trial.\n\nUpon arrival to the lab, participants will be asked to indicate if they have consumed alcohol or caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours, respectively. They will not be asked to specify exactly what they have consumed, but if they provide a positive indication, their trial will be rescheduled for another day. Participants will provide a small urine sample in a clean urine cup, and a nude body mass will be measured. Upon arrival to the lab, hydration status will be assessed by urine specific gravity, nude body mass and urine color. Participants will only be permitted to continue to the exercise trial if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) \u22641.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. If USG is greater than 1.025 then the subject will be rescheduled for a different day. Participants will be given instructions at the prior visit about how to obtain desired hydration status for the upcoming trial. Researchers will insert an esophageal probe. Only trained personnel are permitted to insert the esophageal probe (no undergraduates will be allowed). Participants will insert a rectal probe and wear a heart rate monitor strap. Additionally, participants will wear 9-site Biopac skin temperature sensors. Researchers will apply the skin temperature sensors with medical tape to the participants' chest, upper arm, forearm, thigh, neck, abdomen, thigh, back, and calf (anterior and posterior). Participants will also wear iButtons (wireless skin temperature sensors) on their chest, upper arm, forearm, thigh, and calf (anterior and posterior). The participants will also be asked to complete a subjective sleep questionnaire upon arriving to the lab. Participants will wear an active combat uniform (ACU) during the exercise trials. Three ADU sizes for the blouse and pants (small, medium, large) will be available for the participants. A belt will be used to ensure the ACU fits appropriately. Participants will not be able to keep the ACU- ADUs will be washed (according to manufacturer's instructions) and re-used for participants. ADU manufacturer's instructions is identical to standard washing cycle (detergent and washing machine dry). The ACU will be weighed before and after use to measure sweat captured in the clothing. Participants will wear the wrist-based devices (provided by BHSAI) on their non-dominant arm throughout the testing. The wrist device must be placed approximately 1-inch proximal to the wrist and be fitted snugly for accurate heart-rate measurements. The wrist device is used to estimate heart rate using infrared technology. The wrist device estimates of heart rate will be compared to the polar heart rate monitor (gold standard). The body alerting system uses heart rate from the wrist device and the environmental conditions to estimate body temperature. The sponsor of the study will use rectal temperature and the 7-site skin temperature sensors to alter the algorithm (not in real time- from the collected data) to better estimate body temperature. The future goal is to have the body alerting system imbedded in the watch. Participants will wear another wrist-based device (WHOOP) on the arm that does not have the BHSAI device. The WHOOP device will monitor heart rate variability and sleep. Participants will be asked to wear this device daily for the duration of the study.\n\nParticipants will enter the environmental chamber and sit for 30 minutes to become equilibrated. The environmental chamber will be set to 30-40\u00b0C ambient temperature, 30-70% relative humidity After baseline measures of heart rate, rectal temperature, participants will complete the perceptual indices. Participants will also complete an environmental symptoms questionnaire (ESQ).\n\nThe trial will consist of two 40-minute intervals of cycling from 7W/kg to 15 W/kg. Each 40-minute exercise block will be followed by a rest break where cooling will occur. Participants will be allowed to drink ad libitum throughout the exercise trial. The participant will be cooled for approximately 30 minutes with their assigned cooling modality. Rectal and esophageal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, perceptual measures, and mood (POMS, described below) will be collected at various time points before, during, and after exercise and cooling. Metabolic heat production will be measured using indirect calorimetry (mask connected to metabolic cart) during all four trials.\n\nPassive Cooling: Participants will be asked to sit in a chair in the climate chamber for passive cooling.\n\nMist-fan cooling: A mist-fan will be placed next to the participant and will mist-fan only their hands and forearms during mist-fan cooling. Participants will be asked to roll up their ADU sleeves to increase skin surface area. The temperature of the mist and wind speed of the fan will be recorded.\n\nForearm immersion: The participant will place their forearm in approximately 20\u00b0C water during forearm immersion.\n\nIce Towel: a towel that can hold water for extended periods will be used and submerged in an ice-water mixture (\\~2 C). Researchers will gently squeeze the towel to remove excess water (but remain saturated with water) and then apply to both forearms and hands snuggly so that there is no air gap between the towel and the extremity. Apply for 1-5 minutes and then replace it with another fresh, cold towel. This step would ensure that the forearms and hands have near about constant application temperature as the towel would get warm over the application period. The process will be repeated for the entire cooling duration.\n\nData collection will be divided into two separate phases. A pilot study will be first conducted in which the first two participants will complete all study laboratory visits. Data from those trials will be shared with the sponsor for review before continuation of data collection. Participants will undergo the same procedures for the pilot testing as regular testing. Pilot testing data will be included in the dataset. Following approval from the sponsor, data collection will resume. Each trial will be approximately 4 hours.\n\nAll devices will be properly cleaned according to manufacturer's instruction prior to use by other participants.",
